- Crumbs.

- A gruelling week at work down the data mine. Some intense data wrangling, and then, as a sort of treat, I did some other things like finally changing a certain primary key to a surrogate key, and moving from Travis CI to GitHub Actions.

- A noticeable spike in website traffic on Monday, coincident with the increase in numbers of (empty) buses driving about.

- I've been jetlagged, which is something as I haven't been on any jets.

- Such a shame that Iain Lee and Katherine Boyle's radio programme, on the upsetting talkRADIO, is no more. I'd only been listening for a month or so, like I'm cursed or something (although there's no other evidence to support that). On the other hand, a relief that I'll never have to listen to talkRADIO again.

- A(nother) birthday Zoom, which was a verb even before the zeitgeisty videoconferencing app had been thought of. We had a good old ding dong around the old Joanna, and the thrill of seeing people's bookshelves and things extends to one's extended family.
