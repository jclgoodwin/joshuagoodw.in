- Did some work. A bit more productive than last week, but still at a leisurely pace.

- Watched some of [the wildly popular YouTube programme <cite>Hot Ones</cite>](https://www.theverge.com/2019/10/31/20938739/hot-ones-sean-evans-youtube-guests-gordon-ramsey-idris-elba-late-night-tv), an interview series where the gimmick is that guests eat increasingly spicy pucks of chicken gristle as the interview goes along. Most of the guests are inevitably unknown to this non-American audience, but not all.

    - I didn't immediately warm to the host's interview style. It's clear that he does lots of research – nerd! – and prepares the questions carefully, and reads them out like a robot presenting a YouTube video. But that becomes quite effective as soon as the interviewees start to sweat and whimper.

    - It turns out that _dabbing_, a term of art used in some of the exclamatory video titles, is not [the youthful fad dance move/gesture](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dab_(dance)) but rather dab as in "dab of ranch" – the brave application of additional hot sauce to already hot birdmeat. But I'm quite pleased I thought it was the other thing because I think it means I'm slightly cool.

    - The URL of that <cite>Verge</cite> article misspells Ramsay as "Ramsey" (as in <cite>Alf Ramsey's Kitchen Nightmares</cite>). Is it an SEO thing? [Google Trends reveals](https://trends.google.com/trends/explore?geo=GB&q=gordon%20ramsey,gordon%20ramsay) that most people use the correct Scottish spelling, especially in Scotland. Troublingly, there are some searches for "gordon ramsey bitcoin". [In the US](https://trends.google.com/trends/explore?geo=US&q=gordon%20ramsey,gordon%20ramsay), people in Nebraska are disproportionately interested in the professional cook.

    - The automatically generated closed captions (subtitles) are quite poor. They must make at least a hundred pounds from tie-in condiment merchandise sales, so it's a shame that's not reinvested in accessibility.

- [This investigative journalism about a scam on Airbnb](https://www.vice.com/en_us/article/43k7z3/nationwide-fake-host-scam-on-airbnb) is such good work by Allie Conti for "Murdoch's hipster bible" <cite>Vice</cite>. (Not sure it's still just a _hipster bible_ – is this like <cite>Private Eye</cite> seemingly endlessly making fun of <cite>Buzzfeed</cite>'s important journalism for sitting alongside [lists and quizzes](https://www.buzzfeed.com/lukelewis/24-times-private-eye-nailed-it-in-2014)?)

- Gave some coins to Tim Apple. Now I have a telephone with an uncracked screen and a dry camera.
