<p>That new movie-film about the pretend wizard. (<cite>Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows &#8211; Part 2</cite>. It is the last one, ever.)</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>A goblin (whose name must be Griphook) says &#8220;prehaps&#8221; for &#8220;perhaps&#8221;. My favourite part of the film.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>Accio</em> is pronounced in a surprising way. How is it that I had not noticed this before? Well, it turns out that <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_spells_in_Harry_Potter#Accio_.28Summoning_Charm.29">three different sounds</a> are strewn around the different media. It happens that I leapt to the same conclusion as the US audiobooks (&#8220;<em>assio</em>”), although I&#8217;ve never listened to one of them. Now I think the canonical articulation must be the that which appears in the films (&#8220;<em>ackio</em>”), because it also appears in the videogames and that&#8217;s how democracy works. (This is the humblest day of my life.)</p>
<p>(In what other, non-random ways would the US audiobook be different to the UK one? I don&#8217;t remember the &#8220;aluminium&#8221; word ever appearing. Someone, I expect, must enjoy a hamburger somewhere. Because that there is all of what the United States is.)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Lord Voldemort has no nose. So how does he smell? Terrible.</p>
<p>(Is he a hereditary peer?)</p>
<p>(Some newspapers had a thing about a poorly cat that was abandoned because it looked like a bit like Lord Voldemort. In fact, the cat looked like a cat. Well, maybe if you read the books properly, it becomes clear that the real Lord Voldemort should look like a cat after all, and that Ralph Fiennes is just inaccurate &#8211; as someone who assumed that a house-elf must be the shape of a pillow since its clothes are fashioned from a pillowcase, I wouldn&#8217;t know.)</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Everyone dies at the end. (Not really.)</p>
