title: Didn&#8217;t break, wasn&#8217;t bad
---

<p>Richard &#8220;Richard H Cooper&#8221; Cooper <a href="http://richardhcooper.blogspot.co.uk/2013/02/breaking-bad-post-traumatic-masterpiece.html">calls <cite>Breaking Bad</cite> &#8220;a post-traumatic masterpiece&#8221;</a>. Now, some &#8220;major spoilers&#8221; are contained there &#8211; well, not many I much remembered or even remember again now, but the warning&#8217;s in place &#8211; well, clearly I was in a fugue state for most of my viewing, but that didn&#8217;t impair my enjoyment. Hey, what&#8217;s so bad about downforce, anyway? (Do you see what I did there?)</p>
<p>Cooper&#8217;s &#8220;Finger-Steepling and Sharks&#8221;, there, is a whole thing of that kind of stuff. It might all be interesting. They say blogging is dead. Now, can he tell us why they don&#8217;t make marmalade with proper sugar any longer? And can he make us some barrels? (Do you see what I did there?)</p>
