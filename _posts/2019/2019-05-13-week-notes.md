The "volume up" button on my information pad stopped working.
Given the recklessness of [watching TV in the bath](https://twitter.com/doodlyroses/status/1109647957765181440), 
it was bound to happen sooner or later.
It died doing what it loved – increasing the volume.
In fact, on the final day it started doing so unbidden,
so I'm relieved that the eventual failure mode was inertia,
not perpetually increasing the volume.
Now I can still adjust the volume – by touching the screen – which is a bit "like an animal", but I can be a grown-up and cope with the inconvenience.

Not much litter around the territory lately.
Perhaps it's hidden by the newly vigorous growth of vegetation,
or perhaps it supports the "broken windows theory" – that visible signs of "crime" encourage more crime, and ergo a lack of visible signs of fly-tipping, for example, discourages fly-tipping.
Speaking of visible signs, instead I scraped a thick layer of dirt from a road sign, and propped up another that was resting face-down in some grass – perhaps that's what I do now.

I did some work. Performance enhancements. How satisfying. [Datadog](https://www.datadoghq.com/) fantastically useful.
