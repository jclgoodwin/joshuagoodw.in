This week, I most enjoyed the plosive sound of lifting an AeroPress coffee plunger from off of a wet granite surface.

I did some work. Colouring in – by which I mean data entry, to make all the oblongs on [the map](https://bustimes.org/vehicles) the same colours as the actual vehicles they represent – continues to be a strong absorber of time, a Sisyphian task, so I'm so grateful to the salt-of-the-earth correspondents who notice when their local omnibuses have been repainted. I also made some automated tests faster – "almost twice as fast" as before – which is always nice.

I wheeled my bicycle across a heath at what just happened to be the right time to see a steam train. I only saw it from afar because some men who like trains were standing in wait, and one dislikes what one most resembles.

We saw <cite>Chernobyl</cite>. It was good fun identifying Finchy from off of <cite>The Office</cite> and Lane Pryce from off of <cite>Mad Men</cite> and DI Brandyce from off of <cite>Line of Duty</cite>. I was reminded of the weak, peurile sixth form joke punchline "Chernobyl fall off", which is  actually funnier than the correct "fall out".
