This week, it was warm. I bicycled towards the Norfolk Broads, where I mismanaged the temperature of a Magnum like some kind of child.
On a related note, there were some strongly held opinions on the internet site Twitter this week about whether a choc ice on a stick is a type of "ice lolly" –  ¯\\\_(ツ)\_/¯.

It was a nice ride, but marred by the bumpiness of the cycle track – I've endured shorter rides along such a surface, but this time I discovered the limit. What a relief it was to rejoin a proper road, despite the presence of motor cars (and, this week, combine harvesters and associated tractors and lorries thundering about), until the tarmac began to melt and adhere to the tyres forming a noisy if puncture-resistant coating. 

Now it's been grey and damp for two days, and the heat is all forgotten. I've cut my hair. Good week.
