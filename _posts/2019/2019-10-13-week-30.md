One day this week, I received a free pair of socks. The next day, I received another, completely unrelated free pair of socks. Quite remarkable, and to think I've always had to buy socks before now. Is this what it's like to be an influencer? Everything else that happened this week seems rather dull by comparison.

I did some work. Got down to fewer than 200 _pending vehicle edits_. And then I spent a little time focusing on my big and grand rewriting of some stuff, and then suddenly there were hundreds more edits waiting for me to check. Which is a wonderful problem to have, and I'm very grateful to the enthusiastic fellows. It's just that [there are so many buses and coaches](https://bustimes.org/map).

The approval process is necessary, because some joker keeps marking some buses as ice cream vans, and I don't always agree with the punctuation choices of even well-meaning enthusiastic fellows. I could make my job easier by letting people log in, or recording people's IP addresses, allowing me to identify trustworthy people's user accounts or IP addresses, but ... GDPR.

The big and grand project is all bleeding coming together. I've deployed a bit of the new stuff, which caused just the right amount of brokenness (enough to provide me with some learnings, but no more than my users are accustomed to), and helped me to fix a problem involving certain places (e.g. Whitley Bay) where, like the Bermuda Triangle (actually more like the Mapimí Silent Zone) buses would vanish from the map.

Against all advice, I installed macOS Catalina, which is ¯\\\_(ツ)\_/¯:

- Downloading the thing took several attempts.
  The copper wires here are to blame for that, but it's disappointing that one can't easily resume an interrupted download.
  Eventually I resorted to using 4G.

- My computer (the last of the laptops with a good keyboard) turns out to be too old to support
  [the feature that lets you use an iPad as a secondary display](https://www.macrumors.com/guide/sidecar/).

- Chrome has [an unfortunate bug](https://bugs.chromium.org/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=1005969) where the system font,
  San Francisco, is rendered with uncomfortably tight tracking. I've started using Safari a bit more.

- Apart from that, it's unimpeachable, rock solid:

Still watching <cite>The Simpsons</cite>, which is still great. Managed only a bit of [Danny Dyer gameshow <cite>The Wall</cite>](https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2019/oct/09/the-wall-proper-nonsense-but-proof-that-danny-dyer-is-now-a-national-icon) – Dyer is, of course, tremendous, but, ugh, the contestants are all members of the public, and aren't the public dire? With their dowdy faces and skin and hair and clothes. Ugh.
