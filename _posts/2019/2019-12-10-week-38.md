What happened this week?

Some work. Needing a break from other kinds of work,
I did some of my tax return, which was just the break I needed.

Retrospective _review of the year_ (and _decade_) type things have started to appear,
which makes me angrier than the Hulk as there's still most of this month left.
Still, I found my Spotify "Decade Wrapped" mildly diverting,
and [Kicks Condor's list of hyperlinks of the decade](https://href.cool/2010s/),
and the latest [52 things Tom Whitwell has learned](https://medium.com/fluxx-studio-notes/52-things-i-learned-in-2019-8ee483e6c816) (in _fewer than 52 weeks_).

A spontaneous trip to our nation's capital, where I saw some sort of [intergalactic jazz](https://www.songkick.com/concerts/37149184-comet-is-coming-at-o2-shepherds-bush-empire).

In the process of trying to obtain some disposable cutlery with which to eat a cupful of hot gravy, mashed potatoes and sausages,
I bought a sachet of descaler, with which I later descaled the kettle. And now the inside of the kettle is wonderfully shiny â€“ highly recommended.

One of my cultural highlights of the week was [Limmy pointing out the strange on-stage antics of Samuel T. Herring of Future Islands](https://www.twitch.tv/videos/516281372?t=01h18m05s). Actually, the whole band look preternaturally unstylish, which is rather admirable.
