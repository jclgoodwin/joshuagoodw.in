- I've been making [something](https://streetlife.bustimes.org/) using [the "Street Manager" open data about roadworks in England](https://www.gov.uk/guidance/find-and-use-roadworks-data).
  There are synergistic synergies with other things I've made, and haven't we all stories of passenging on a motorbus (or another combination of gerund and wheeled noun) only to discover that the gas/water/electricity/telephone wallahs have duggen a big hole without telling anyone?

  There's already a website that used to be called "roadworks.org",
  now just part of a whole "suite of operational tools" made by a whole compamy of beshirted smiling people.
  I look at it sometimes, it's useful, but is there's some point in making yet another thing that's a bit like that existing thing?

  Apart from anything else, I've been using [OpenLayers](https://openlayers.org/) for the first time, about which I have some complaints, but this isn't the place.

- For some while, I've been [suspending avodo pits in water](https://inhabitat.com/how-to-grow-an-avocado-tree-from-an-avocado-pit/), and at last one (an unusally big one) has sprouted roots and a stem so into some compost it's gone, which I've just realised is possibly too early so back into the water it will go.  

- A dog and a person spent a night in the living room here. Some other things happened but I'm tired.
