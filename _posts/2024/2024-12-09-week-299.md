- ðŸŽ¦ Obviously I thought <i>Conclave</i> (2024) was going to be about something being the opposite of convex. ~~(And, if you think about it, it is.)~~
  It was cool to see so many of those fish-faced [Sitcar Voyager](https://www.imcdb.org/vehicle_1947782-Sitcar-Voyager.html) mini coaches (the cardinals' shuttle buses).

- Twice back and forth to glittering London for the last time this year, surely.

  - Stewart Lee <i>vs the Man-Wulf</i>. The werewolf costume is quite special. Sat adjacent to none other than Chris Morris, who arrived wearing a yellow bicycling jacket similar to the one I use, which we could have bonded over and become friends.

  - Remi Wolf, a fine young woman making really exciting pop music.

  Thatâ€™s an anomalous number of things with wolf/wulf in their name. The contrast between Lee's uncomfortably tight jeans (a man who's mocked the <i>Top Gear</i> audience's "supermarket denim" before) and the baggy pants of Wolf and her band was, somehow, notable.

  The second train home was delayed by signalling problems, and then further delayed by waiting for some police to arrive (to discipline a naughty passenger, or perhaps arrest a flange or bogey or other bit of the train). So Â£2.24 of sweet [Delay Repay](https://www.theguardian.com/money/2024/oct/24/thanks-to-this-unsung-magic-compensation-scheme-i-now-relish-a-delayed-train "Adrian Chiles: Thanks to this unsung, magic compensation scheme, I now relish a delayed train") money is mine, should I choose to claim it.
