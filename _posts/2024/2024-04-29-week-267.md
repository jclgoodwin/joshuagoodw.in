- I use the font [Charter](https://practicaltypography.com/charter.html) for the body text on this website these days,
  and I think it's really great, apart from one thing.
  It has glyphs for the fi and fl ligatures, but none of the versions I could find had the OpenType lookup tables to make the substitution automatically, you know what I mean? Well, I just [used FontForge](https://fontforge.org/docs/tutorial/editexample4.html#lookups-and-features) â€“ where by "just" I mean "moments ago", not "simply" â€“ and I think it's worked and it's an improvement?

  - The previous highlight of my typographic career was adding a Å· to [Black Jack](https://www.fontsquirrel.com/fonts/blackjack)
    (for a thing about Wales's LlÅ·n Peninsula) (also using FontForge). And I thought the nadir was a reply to Erik Spiekermann on Twitter, but I just checked and turns out I wasn't that shamefully reply guyâ€“ish.

- Watching [a compilation of some old Vine videos](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cY9XGulvYPE),
  I noticed something about them â€“ an I donâ€™t know what, a je ne sais quoi?
  â€“ like a distinctive smell thatâ€™s peculiar to Vines, that transported me back to the last time I watched [a different compilation of some other Vines](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fmYN78sKTPc "Ravensburger!"). Is it the framerate, the compression algorithm, or just what cameraphones were like 10 years ago?

  Anyway. Itâ€™s so pathetic that Vine withered and died instead of becoming what TikTok became, and it says something about the decline of the west or something.

  I thought, as I have before, about how everyone these days has a Prince Andrew joke, you simply have to, like he occupies a role once filled by Å koda motor cars, and so Andy's best hope for rehabilitation could be getting bought by the Volkswagen Group?

- ðŸ“º <cite>The Fall</cite>. (Yes, everything I've been watching is from 10 years ago.) There's a fellow in it who looks disquietingly like Eric Cantona. I'm yet to reach the point where the phrase ["fetch the bolt cutters"](https://www.vanityfair.com/hollywood/2020/04/fiona-apple-fetch-the-bolt-cutters-gillian-anderson-the-fall "The title of Fiona Appleâ€™s revelatory, ferocious Fetch the Bolt Cutters comes from the second season finale of The Fall") is spoken, and perhaps I'll applaud or something when I do.
