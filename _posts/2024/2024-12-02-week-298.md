- It's the worst time of the year, but less crummy than this time last year maybe, I can't really remember.

  I keep doing my walking, cycling, errands, etc. in the dark evenings, which is daft – what’s stopping me doing what I want in the daylight,
  and doing all of my important work after sunset? But I suppose doing it this way round saves a bit of the cost of electric lighting.

  Every year I think of doing a socially medium advent calendar of photos of fly-tipped festive disposable coffee cups, but I never do.

- [Those Japanese nail clippers](https://daringfireball.net/thetalkshow/2024/11/09/ep-413) are good, but maybe it's just the dazzle of their sharp newness, who knows how quickly they'll grow blunt and horrible.
