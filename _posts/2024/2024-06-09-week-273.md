- After being so smug last week about my frozen berry habit, I got a blackberry seed stuck in my teeth, but the day or so of minor annoyance was almost worth it for the satisfaction of finally dislodging it (it made an audible noise as it landed in the bathroom sink).

- Some work. 
  You'll be fascinated to learn that I've eliminated the need to use Docker regularly, and I've made my tests run a minute or two faster,
  which is not the same as the important work I'd hoped to do but never mind.

  Which reminds me I've been reading <i>How to Make Things Faster</i>, written by an enterprise software man, which contains [a story about having the shits in South Carolina](https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/how-to-make/9781098147051/ch51.html).

- It was time to re-setup my [fragile digital terrestrial television receiver](/2022/11/week-193),
  ready to feel superior to everyone struggling to use ITV X to watch the Euros.
  I wished I'd made some notes last time, so here I'm making some for next time: in order to get the few HD channels, I had to [look up the frequencies for my local transmitter](https://ukfree.tv/transmitters/tv/Tacolneston) and slightly correct the Tvheadend settings accordingly.

  Just weeks ago, I finally threw away a mysterious sachet of little screws, and now it turns out that they were the “mechanical spacers” for attaching the [Pi TV Hat](https://www.amazon.co.uk/Melopero-Raspberry-DVB-TV-uHAT/dp/B07JKH36VR?tag=joshgood-21) securely to the Raspberry Pi. Of course I'd coped for a few years without them, but it means a careless movement can unseat the thingy from the GPIO pins and this is why people become hoarders.

- Ordered some wet, soupy noodly supper as treat, and someone hadn't sealed the container properly and the broth leaked out. I was chill, but I feel bad that I didn't think to offer the delivery fellow some paper towels to help clean up the inside of his insulated bag.

- Last week a man asked me if I knew where the [Copmanthorpe](https://bustimes.org/localities/copmanthorpe) bus was, and it took me a while to realise he wasn't saying "the common folk bus".
