- This has nothing to do with anything that happened this week,
  but a while ago I read a quirky [feature about "rejection therapy"](https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2024/jan/13/an-experiment-in-ritual-humiliation-would-a-month-of-rejection-therapy-make-me-fearless "‘An experiment in ritual humiliation’: would a month of rejection therapy make me fearless?"),
  which can be described as asking people for things to which the answer is likely to be "no". 

  I do think my almost-fear of asking questions is a bit of a problem sometimes, but this is not the place for introspection. I found myself embarking on my own small project, which consisted of asking for a "filter coffee" in Starbuckses – it's advertised on the menu, but [seldom actually available](https://www.reddit.com/r/starbucks/comments/q7u2se/why_do_starbucks_in_the_uk_almost_never_have/ "Why do Starbucks in the UK almost never have filter coffee ready?"), and when the "no" came I'd settle for a watery, more expensive americano. It's stupid when I could get a nicer, more ethical drink from any independent cafe, but there's something about the quest for the unobtainable that makes me want to keep trying. I wonder if it's possible to make a map similar to [the McDonald's broken ice cream machine one](https://mcbroken.com/ "McBroken").

- (Reminds me: I caught another expired domain name at the start of the year, [davidlynchcoffee.co.uk](https://davidlynchcoffee.co.uk/). It's got some what tossers call _link equity_, so I should auction it off.)

- The Old Farm, El Tractico, the East Anglian derby. The first time I’ve seen horse shit on the road here – on other matchdays, apparently the crowds are too mild-mannered to need policing on horseback.
  I hope someone entrepreneurial has scooped it up to sell to rose gardeners; it's a good fertiliser but absolutely not suitable for houseplants.

  The above commentary on the power of branding is sure to appear on the cover of a Business Studies textbook soon, and I'm blown away by how quickly it appeared when I typed "horse muck" into Apple Photos.

  ([Here's what the sign looked like in 2008](https://www.geograph.org.uk/photo/1042763), nearly ten years earlier; imagine what it looks like now.)

- I noticed the skin on my face looked more radiant, less dry, which must be the effect of drinking lots of water to stifle a cough, so that's something.
