- I've become someone who brushes his teeth before breakfast, not after. Doesn't it make the coffee taste minty? No it doesn't, grow up.

- In the Sainsbury's loos, a man dressed like a police officer was using the hand dryer, standing in the way of a washbasin, so I had to use the other, lower washbasin whose lowness contributed to me splashing water on my (fairly light-coloured) trousers.

- The Apple event, the coverage thereof and especially people's toots about it, are a bit like when Alan Sugar tweets the Tottenham score. Anyway after all that I bought some [Envy apples](https://applerankings.com/envy-apple-review/); I wanted to try some [RedPop](https://www.redpop-apple.com/en/redpop.html) but I could find none.

  John Gruber, who I increasingly worry has been kicked in the head by a horse, has been making some disparaging noises [about the European Union](https://daringfireball.net/linked/2024/06/21/apple-intelligence-dma-financial-times "slide into a technological backwater"), to which I counter:
  here in Europe we can still get an Apple Watch with a functioning blood oxygen sensor, and an iPhone with a physical SIM slot. (And I was going to say gambling apps in the App Store but not sure how good and/or special that is.)

- Due to an oversight, and the visual similarity between the numbers 3 and 8, the URL slugs for weeks 284–286 here were numbered 234–236, and it's too late now.
  But in several weeks' time they'll have dropped off the RSS feed and maybe I can fix them then.
