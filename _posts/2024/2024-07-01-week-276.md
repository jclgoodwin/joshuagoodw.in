- Big week. After years of foot-dragging and it being a sort of white whale, I'm finally displaying my calculated "ex-pected" departure times (for most bus stops in England and Wales etc, subject to availability and all that). It's imperfect and done in a slipshod manner, and I was ready to rollback the changes if the servers freaked out about all the extra work, but they didn't – computers are fast. And now that it's public, I've an incentive to keep improving it.

- A series of scummy cups of tea led me to seek out [those wire balls](https://www.galaxus.de/en/page/will-this-wire-wool-ring-save-your-kettle-from-limescale-25989) for putting in kettles –
  they work on the theory that the limescale gets attracted to the large surface area,
  leaving the water and the heating element cleaner.
  They're hard to find in shops – kettle-mongers in hard water areas are missing an opportunity to cross-sell a complementary product, or maybe they think there's more money in selling chemical descalers and replacement kettles.
  So I searched an e-commerce website, but “kettle ball” dredged up gym equipment and “kettle wire” got me a load of cables.

  Which made me remember this bit in <cite>The Castafiore Emerald</cite>, and I wondered about the cable/wire situation in other languages, whether any only have one word for them.

- The live music I've enjoyed in June 2024.

  Girl Ray (a) (Islington Assembly Hall), marvellous.

  CSS (a) (Islington Assembly Hall). I remember when they were an impediment to googling information about Cascading Style Sheets, but oh how the tables have turned.
  Yes they played the song from the Zune advert and the song from the iPod advert (they're the same song).

  Above all I'm grateful to my immune system for making me feel OK just in time to go to leafy leafy London.

- One thing I did last week was take down, using my knowledge of 3M Command damage-free hanging solutions, some framed posters – [_live, laugh, love_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Live,_Laugh,_Love) in a cursive font, things of that nature –
  and I can't believe no one's done a hilarious _see it, say it, sorted_ poster in the same style.
