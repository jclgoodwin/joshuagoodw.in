- This week I have been mostly on my holidays. I've got sand in my socks.

  The website [got knocked for six](https://status.bustimes.org/) by some sudden changes to upstream data things â€“ not great timing on the face of it, but actually my relaxed holiday demeanour helped.
  (Reading [between the lines, they've](https://github.com/department-for-transport-BODS/bods/commits/dev/) replaced a component of a thing, which to their credit has made the big map of live bus locations update quicker and has fixed at least one long-standing little bug â€“ it's just a shame about the new problems.)

- The Oasis pre-sale ballot form rejected my usual email address, accused it of being invalid,
  because the [local part](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Email_address#Local-part) (before the @) is one character long.
  Never mind, that _someone_ hasn't read RFC 5322 isn't my only reason for not pursuing it any further, and such is the folly of having
  a show-offy unusual email address.

  (It's not really a problem, because I can make up a longer email address because I have catch-all wildcards set up. That's cool apart from the problem of misremembering which email address I've told whom, and on balance the extra spam and mis-addressed emails are more trouble than they are interesting. I remember Mr cardigan.com getting messages intended for, I guess, the Cardigan Mountain School for arrogant young men that owns cardigan.org ... now I've wasted some time on the Wayback Machine failing to find the blog post about that, but I enjoyed [this](https://web.archive.org/web/20090304013022/http://textism.com/article/524/this-again "RIP") on the way.) (I regret the .in domain too, having no connection to India and it's tricky to say out loud.)

- I can still proudly say I've never used Airbnb, due to rigid dogma, as long as we don't count the times I've let someone else book and BACS'd them my share of the cost, like Richard Stallman having an assistant use nonfree software on his behalf. (That may be a misremembering of [how Stallman operates](https://stallman.org/stallman-computing.html), but I'm making fun of me not him.)

- ðŸŽ® Had a nice time playing [<i>Thank Goodness You're Here</i>](https://thankgoodness.game/). It's lewd, and at one point it's a bit gross and nightmarish, but I had no actual nightmares.
