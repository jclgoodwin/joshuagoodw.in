- I read fbb‚Äôs blog ‚Äì he writes about public transport information and stuff ‚Äì
  and with each new post I worry: what if this time he‚Äôs cast his critical eye on _my work_? 
  Well, [the time finally came][fbb],
  and maybe the old buffer is right about the technology tail wagging the information dog and all that.

  (It‚Äôs a shame he doesn‚Äôt know how to do hyperlinks ‚Äì
  they‚Äôre such a fundamental part of the web that one normally calls them ‚Äúlinks‚Äù to save time.
  He‚Äôs an older fellow, but in a way he‚Äôs bang up to date with the modern "link in bio" culture of screenshotting.
  And he embeds YouTube videos by downloading and re-uploading them, unintentionally obscuring their authorship ‚Äì again, incompetence rather than malice I'm sure.)

  (Reminds me: last month there was [a parliamentary debate][parl "Real-Time Bus Information: North-East"] that was sort of about my laziness/failure to do my job properly. The week before, I'd had some confused/confusing questions from a parliamentary intern; I'd've tried harder to write better answers if I'd known there was a chance they might end up in <cite>Hansard</cite>.)
  
- A low-speed falling-off of the bike in the course of some industrial espionage. The main humblingly minor injury is a blistered middle finger tip, which impairs wiping and typing.

- Sam Campbell (h), the talented weird little guy (days before his debut on the only-good-thing-on-TV <cite>WILTY</cite>). Last year, when I saw him do ten excellent minutes, I found his material about hotels with swimming pools hard to relate to, but then mere days later I stayed in a nobby hotel where, sure enough, there were wet people in the lift. 

  I googled the Twickets user I bought my ticket from, and turns out they (and their house) were once the subject of an episode of <cite>Grand Designs</cite> ‚Äì how interesting.

- üì∫ <cite>Criminal Record</cite> was good.
  (The Apple TV apps are surprisingly bad ‚Äì the criminals of the world of piracy I used to watch <cite>Slow Horses</cite> somehow deliver a less frustrating user experience.)
