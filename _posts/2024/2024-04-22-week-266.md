- Guess who's now [the #2 UK ground transportation website](https://www.similarweb.com/website/bustimes.org/), up one place.
  I know it's meaningless,
  SimilarWeb's measurements are dubious,
  and nationalrail.co.uk's decline is probably because of their transition to a single-page application, 
  but can't you let me have my moment in the sun? 

- Happy asparagus season. Asparagus is overrated, but I've come round to thinking it's OK,
  and the asparagus they have now seems thicker and juicier than the asparagus of my youth.

That'll have to do.
