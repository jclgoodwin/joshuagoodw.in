- When I free-pour [muesli](https://www.independent.co.uk/life-style/food-and-drink/recipe-chopped-chillies-for-a-hot-start-1471137.html "family recipe") I often pour too much, more than I can handle, so I wondered what size an official serving of muesli was. This led me to the website [singleportions.co.uk](https://www.singleportions.co.uk) and the distinctive, passionate style of its product descriptions, the sort of writing we'll miss when all marketing copy is produced by large language models:

  > This is ALSO not stored in a 'plastic dispenser' as seen in "poor" Hotels and Guesthouses - how do we know how long that cereal has been there ? what's the BBE date ??!! (and stale!) Always ask for fresh, sealed and dated cereal ; and if they don't have any - suggest they come to this website

  > This is NOT a large box of - Frosties - that go stale the minute the box is opened - each one of these is fresh and the same as you would get in a Top Class Hotel

  Iâ€™ve never had breakfast at a Top Class Hotel, so I don't know if that's true. I keep my (homemade) muesli in a plastic box and it hasn't gone stale, but maybe it will now I'm only having 45g at a time. Alas I won't buy anything from singleportions.co.uk, because actually I care about seagulls not choking to death on plastic waste.

  (This dredged up a memory of Stewart Lee telling a made-up story about David Attenborough stealing ketchup sachets, and Iâ€™m pleased by how quickly I found [the audio](https://archive.org/details/BBC_Radio_4_Extra_20161209_230000_Armando_Iannuccis_Charm_Offensive?start=577), an episode of the weak <cite>Armando Iannucciâ€™s Charm Offensive</cite> from 2007, in which two other leading lights of the BBC are accused too.)

- <cite>The Holdovers</cite>, a Christmas film ingeniously released in midâ€“late January in the UK (and why not).
  Not quite as funny as the men guffawing at the back of the room seemed to find it, but what is?
