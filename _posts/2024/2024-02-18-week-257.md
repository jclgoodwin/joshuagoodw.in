- The local app-based bicycle/scooter hire joint has designated parking bays, and they charge a Â£5 surcharge for parking anywhere else. Now they've done [a new thing](https://help-bikes.beryl.cc/en/articles/8925919-norwich-beryl-bonus "Earn credit for moving an out-of-bay vehicle back to a bay"): if you hire a bike/scooter that someone's left outwith a designated parking bay, and you return it to a designated parking bay, they add 10 "bonus minutes" to your balance. (So if you take less than 10 minutes riding to the nearest bay, you're quids in.) It's a good idea, and actually I think it was my idea, but I'm not bitter about not being credited or anything.

  You can see where this is going: yes, I've been scouring the map for stray bikes and scooters, and pounding the P, like it's (I imagine) a shit Pokemon Go. Alas, some of the vehicles on the map turned out to be in people's houses or back yards â€“ fair enough, they'd paid their five pounds â€“ and I didn't want to trespass, but still I've accumulated 22 free minutes which could come in handy the next time I'm late for an appointment or accidentally walk to Sprowston.
