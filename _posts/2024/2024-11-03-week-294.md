- Was I prepared to change my devicesâ€™ language settings to United States English for the sake of being able to sample the new Apple Intelligence features? Was I buffalo. But it turns out that _on a Macintosh_ itâ€™s just the Siri language setting that you need to change. Anyway, I hate it but I quite like the turns of phrase of some of the generated summaries of emails.

- A fellow has been tweeting some strange, legally actionable things about me and others â€“ certainly an unexpected consequence of running a bus timetable website. I was perturbed for about a day, which is why there are libel laws I suppose, but part of me also quite liked the attention, and I remain fascinated by his barely intelligible stream-of-consciousness writing style and all of his varied political views etc.

- ðŸŽ¦ <i>The Apprentice</i>. The more I learn about Trump, the less I care for him.
  It's an unnecessary film and would have been better if it was about Alan Sugar. (Danny Dyer plays a Sugar-like character in the slightly naff Disney series <i>The Rivals</i>, which is mostly about a load of rubber-faced nobs.)

- <i>The Substance</i>. Dorian Gray for the Brazilian butt lift generation. Thirty thousand gallons of fake blood.
