- A pile of books toppled over last week, which felt like a wake-up call to sell some personal belongings.
  Conveniently, a useful Pyrex beaker I bought came swaddled in several metres of bubble wrap
  – I have some thoughts about online sellers over-packaging things, and wish someone would scientifically investigate exactly how much of various materials is really necessary to protect various goods. 

  The bubble wrap windfall came after I'd already posted a vintage [Nexus 10 tablet](https://uk.webuy.com/product-detail?id=SSAMGTP811016GBC) (my da's), clantily scad in a thin wisp of bubble wrap.
  Still working after 12 years, but the screen had a pissy tinge and the plastic case had deteriorated to become permanently sticky, so I didn't get any money for it in the end, but it's saved me a trip to the recycling centre.

- Cut my finger, an important typing finger, while slicing bread, so it's true that a low-carb/gluten-free diet is healthier.
  Those boxes of plasters (adhesive bandages or "band aids" in some cultures) contain too many big ones and not enough small ones ... I could cut some down to size, but that would risk another injury.

- Greengages are in season – truly the thinking man's plum. (Found some in a dark recess of the Tesco fruit aisle but other greengrocers are available.)
