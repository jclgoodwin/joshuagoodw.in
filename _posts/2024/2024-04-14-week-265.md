  Some work. I had the idea of showing timetabled times on a map like this, and I'm pretty pleased with it. Using MapLibre GL JS's `symbol-sort-key` to prioritise showing timing points when zoomed out.

- The lovely spring weather is nice and all that, but it’s also a reminder of the relentless march of time. If I could keep it winter forever, in order to stay young forever, would I? Actually no.

- Had the saddle and seatpost nicked off my bicycle by some kind of seat-sniffing pervert. It’s not a quick-release clamp, so they must have come prepared with an Allen key. Who would do such a thing?

  I don’t miss the saddle – it was uncomfortable, so maybe the criminal has done my balls etc. a favour, it's easily replaced. But seatposts are harder, the local shop had none in stock, so stealing one starts to make sense! If I did it, I’d steal from an abandoned-looking bike that’s already had a wheel nicked or bent – it might seem like kicking someone while they’re down, but actually it's more ethical if you think about it.

  <!-- Of course, now what if the seatpost that was stolen from me is used as a murder weapon, and  -->

- 📺 <cite>Scoop</cite>, Netflix's film about the Prince Andrew interview ... pointless, but that's art for you. I wondered if they reused the Buckingham Palace set from [<cite>The Crine</cite>](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=epEQhxslprE) for efficiency's sake, but maybe that's not how it works and they're produced by different companies.
 
- ["My" episode of <cite>Taskmaster</cite>](2023/10/week-237#:~:text=To%20Pinewood%20Studios%2C) aired and of course the sense of déjà vu was fun. We saw a row of backs of the audience's heads a few times, but none of the heads looked like mine. ¯\\\_(ツ)\_/¯

- Bought some athlete's foot cream (yes, a foot cream belonging to the 00s indie band from Deptford), only to later realise I'd just bought an empty box (empty apart from a bit of paper). So I returned it for a refund and free replacement, which was nice, and it's mad that I didn't notice earlier that the box was empty, and could the tube of cream have dropped out and I've accidentally stolen it? What a funny story.

- Acid reflux! That seems to be the cause of the cough. So I’m off the coffee, tea, tomatoes, jalapenos, alcohol. Even your friend and mine, peppermint tea, is bad because it relaxes the sphincter and we don’t want that.

  “Sphincter” is a horrible word, but I’m minded to start using it for other kinds of valve, e.g. the leaky flush on the toilet.
