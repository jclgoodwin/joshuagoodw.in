- Been watching grainy uploads of [<cite>Only Connect</cite>](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Only_Connect) on YouTube.
  I can't get on board with the Egyptian hieroglyph names – it's Sammy Snake, not "the horned viper please", thank you – but never mind.
  The one [where](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o_eleXkQBkw&t=1531s) the balding men think the surnames of the members of One Direction might be playwrights' or golfers' is great television.

  I guess it's fine that we call things highbrow and lowbrow even though those words come from phrenology, but it can come in useful to win an argument by accusing someone of being a caliper-wielding racist if, say, they snobbily or reverse-snobbily disparage something you like.

- The CrowdStrike incident eh? It knocked adrift a couple of the APIs I use – the Transport for Ireland one and a secret one – for between a bit and a while.
  Here, the council's "real time" bus time display [screens](https://www.norfolkbus.info/ldb/stops/2900N12643) appear to be affected still, but that feels so common that nobody's noticed and it could be an unrelated coincidence. Someone should do a freedom of information request about it.

- Last week's "that avenue of timewasting has been exhausted" was quickly disproven – I was only measuring ¼ of the four servers' traffics – but now it's been exhausted.
  (Oh and in case it sounded like I'm so vain I measure _this_ website's traffic, I'm not/I don't.)

- Maybe the first week all month in which I didn't get caught in some rain, but let the record show that on the hottest day I went to get the leaves out of my ma's ma's gutters and became sweaty which is more or less the same.

  A bit :( in spite of the nicer weather so that's interesting.
