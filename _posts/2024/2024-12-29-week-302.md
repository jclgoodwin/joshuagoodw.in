- Merry whatnot and all that. I'm proud to say I've done no work all week, at least written no code (apart from on a train, which doesn't count). So I hope that puts to bed any suggestion that I "have a workahol problem" or "am like a chocaholic but for work".

- I didn't bring some cheese on a train because I was worried about it getting warm and/or smelling. In fact the train was refreshingly cold, but never mind, there was enough cheese that I didn't need to bring any.

- To Liverpool, where we did much celebrating and walking and I got some Scouse pub-floor-dirt on my coat, and then to Edinburgh where there's a good chance of some rain to wash the dirt off.

- Mince pies: this year I under-filled them, which solved the problem of the mincemeat overflowing and making a sticky mess, but at what cost?
  They'd have been tastier with more filling. And foolishly I left the pastry out of the fridge for a bit, in an unseasonably warm kitchen, supposedly to make it easier to manipulate, but which of course adversely affected its quality.

- Needless to say, Wallace and Gromit's latest adventure was a shimmering delight. Got some <i>M3GAN</i> vibes from it.
