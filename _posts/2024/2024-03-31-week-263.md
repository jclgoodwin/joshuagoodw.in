- Just a bit of work.
  Public transport data continues to reveal new layers of things to learn and unlearn, we continue to plumb new depths. ~

  I made some QR code [stickers](https://bustimes.org/qr/pratts-bottom) a few weeks ago.
  Maybe I won't, or maybe I will write something about the thought that went into that: of course I didn't want to use a [URL shortening service](https://shkspr.mobi/blog/2024/03/what-the-uk-government-gets-wrong-about-qr-codes/ "eugh"), but still I took care to the make the URLs a bit shorter by other means, which made the QR codes [less dense and easier to read](https://www.revk.uk/2024/02/qr-marketing.html), for the small price of the extra complication of having a redirect. There, I've mostly covered it, there's not a lot to it.

- We tried the local [small vendor of Instagrammable vast sandwiches](https://www.instagram.com/bodega175_norwich/) – New York style, _or should I say new yuck‽_ No, I'm glad they were doing a roaring trade. The gimmick is the sandwiches are way over-filled, making them horribly difficult to eat – if Montagu's practical original sandwich is like Issigonis's original Mini, these are like the modern Mini Countryman – and of course I'd prefer it if they were sensible and used a more sensible amount of filling. But if they did that, there'd be less social media buzz and they'd be much less successful. 

- Hot cross buns 2024.
  They tasted a bit plain – not enough spices or salt, and [the wrong kind of sugar](https://twitter.com/dank_ackroyd/status/1772282604248572017 "a clip of the bad broadcaster Rachel Johnson saying “sorry to be granular”, captioned: “the sugar when you realise you bought the wrong one for baking”") – and as ever the crosses looked like [Guy Fawkes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guy_Fawkes#/media/File:Guy_fawkes_torture_signatures.jpg "a barely evident scrawl") had drawn them. But a nice texture, actually the best texture yet, and a nice conduit for marmalade, jam, things of that nature. 

  Here are the 2021 and 2022 HCBs – let's say they're from far enough in the past that I don't feel ashamed. I searched for "bread" in Apple Photos and aren't modern computers brilliant? AI, is that AI?
