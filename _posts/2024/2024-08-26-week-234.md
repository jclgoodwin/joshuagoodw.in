- Defrosted the freezer, and it's left a thin, smooth layer of ice so the drawers slide in and out wonderfully like a toboggan on the Cresta Run.

- Some work. I have a dark mode again â€“ I sort of soft-launched it a while ago, and took some time to improve it, before finally foisting it on the `prefers-color-scheme: dark` crowd this week, and there was less opprobrium than [last time](/2023/08/week-230), in fact there was no opprobrium. 

- Went to grin and wave at the [east coast truckers' convoy](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wPkoUOQWlzw), which was more fun than staying indoors wondering what all the noise's about â€“ actually I couldn't be arsed to wave very much, which suggests I'd be bad at being royal or a pope. Inevitably, seeing all the shiny trucks, looking a bit undignified as they do without a trailer attached, left me yearning to play <i>Euro Truck Simulator 2</i> again.

- ðŸ“º The third serie of <i>Industry</i> (will probably be on the BBC in a month or so, but until then the pirates have it in HEVC format). There's a character named Muck which I thought was yet more inaccurate subtitling (closed captioning), but no, it (Sir Henry Muck)'s his actual name and if you think about it is the sort of name a chap might have.

- In a 2002 episode of <i>Top Gear</i>, J Clarkson says of the Renault Vel Satis, "it's like driving along in Arthur Negus." (That must have been a dated reference at the time, but nowadays it's easier than ever to educate oneself and learn that Negus was an antiques expert [on television](https://www.bbc.com/historyofthebbc/anniversaries/march/going-for-a-song) between the late 60s and early 80s.)
