- Another week older and I've learnt nothing apart from the pronunciations of "Blennerhasset" and "Torpenhow" which have to be some kind of prank.

- The global fuckdown last week led me to the [Security Now](https://www.grc.com/securitynow.htm) podcast. (I don't know if that's a play on "serenity now".) (It's a shame that, since I last heard anything from the TWiT.tv empire it's part of, they've stopped trying to call them "netcasts".) Now I'm hooked – I'm soothed by the sonorous voice of the guy and the Kermit-ish tones of the security expert.

- Had tofu two nights on the trot. Not quite explicably this led me to seek out the <cite>Brass Eye</cite>–esque title sequence of the Piers Morgan programme,
  as I recall phrases like "<span class="caps">woke insanity</span>" appear in large geometric sans serif lit up by lasers, but pfft/I couldn't find it.
  Also I found myself trying to use Google Lens to look up the comfy chairs some nutjobs were sitting on in a video, until I stopped myself – leave it, it's not worth it, the internet is teeming with more ideologically sound ways to find design-forward furniture, and I'm not even planning to buy any.

- Kid Creole and the Coconuts (a), the London Palladium. "This one goes out to all the illegitimate children..."
