- A few days in the Liverpool City Region. Nice.

- If you're paying more than £10 per month for a mobile phone data plan, stop.
  I've been playing the MVNOs off against each other, with a dual-SIM phone, but it feels time to commit to one – probably the daftly named [1pMobile](https://www.1pmobile.com/?friend=G348632J) which combines the good network of EE with the cheapness and ease of leaving of giffgaff etc. I'm only a bit hesitant because turns out my da's moved to the first place I've found where the EE signal is much worse indoors than other networks', but it's not a big problem because WiFi exists.

- If you type "Euro 2024" into the iPhone search box it helpfully informs you that €2,024 is £1,714.21.

- Monday. I've got a sort of cold, which I think is a complication of hayfever, and several flies are flying around in circles, so consistently avoiding the sticky green paper I've pegged to the ceiling that I think they're taunting me, they know what I'm up to. I'd say I only need to be lucky once, they need to be lucky always, but it's only a matter of time before I absent-mindedly walk into the trap.
