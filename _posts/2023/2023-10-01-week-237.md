- Happy Bee Network. Some of the coverage of Greater Manchester's new franchised bus services has elided the fact that they're still _operated_ by the private sector at the end of the day; part of me would like a commitment to either 100% public ownership _or_ total free-market anarchy, not this still uneasy mixture.

  > Shut the fuck up you weasel faced cunt - can you let Andy Burnham, who is an amazing mayor by the way, have his day in the sun? You sad fuck

  I must declare a professional interest: it's advantageous for me that the new Bee Network app isn't yet as good at live bus tracking as some of the old operators' apps were.

- To Pinewood Studios, to watch the studio recording of <cite>Taskmaster</cite> series 17 episode 3. I donâ€™t even like <cite>Taskmaster</cite> as much as a lot of people do â€“ I tend to zone out and go on my phone mid-way through any given episode â€“ but very much enjoyed stepping through the screen and watching it in person. 

  Our first glimpse of the top-secret series 17 line-up was on the [card](https://www.reddit.com/r/taskmaster/comments/irk1aq/has_anyone_ever_realized_greg_has_a_card_just_to/) the titular taskmaster has with their names on. (Like the one in the linked picture, it had one of the contestantsâ€™ surnames spelt incorrectly.) Some indiscreet blabbermouths have since leaked the list on the internet, for those who know where to look â€¦ I hope the full force of Channel 4 and Avalonâ€™s lawyers will rain down on them.

  Anyway. My tiny brain is struggling to cope with having seen a bit of the next series while the current one is airing.

- IDâ€™d at the big Sainsburyâ€™s in Slough, yes I looked too young to buy baba au rhum, and Iâ€™d not brought any ID. Iâ€™m supposed to be flattered â€“ the effects of exfoliating and moisturising â€“ but it meant going without pudding, and possibly the alcoholic chilled dessert spoiling at the checkouts before any staff returned it to the shelf. (Iâ€™m sure _some_ shopsâ€™ point-of-sale systems donâ€™t have it flagged as an age-restricted item.)

  So Slough is dead to me, a bit. I'd gotten a better impression the last time I visited, when it was a sunny day and the bus station hadnâ€™t burnt down yet.

- By the way, FirstGroup plc's timetable data incorrectly lists [a disused, unserved stop](https://bustimes.org/stops/040000001827) that looks like the best stop to alight at for (a mile or so walk to) Pinewood Studios. I've now filled in an online form about it, but I might as well have whispered into the wind or written my message in sand.

- Cistern update: what was I on about last week, talking a load of rubbish? The buttons/rods thing was a red herring.
  But I swear thereâ€™s a knack to flushing in such a way that the valve closes properly post-flush; maybe some people hold the button down too long? Alas, watching how guests flush and telling them they're doing it wrong isn't really tenable.

- ðŸŽ¦ <cite>Talk to Me</cite>. (About some Australian teenagers and their embalmed hand, a tale as old as time.) Freaked my nut out so much that I left behind a half-full bottle of sparkling mango Rubicon.

- <cite>A Haunting in Venice</cite>. My mind wandered to thinking about HTTP caching for a bit. Venice is a silly town â€“ ooh, building on land isn't good enough for you? Pathetic.
