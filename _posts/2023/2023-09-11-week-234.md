- Stevie Wonder was right, it _is_ hotter than July. Itâ€™s annoyingly true that closing all the windows during the daytime keeps the heat out. Blueooth thermometers are great, and this week I learnt of the Xiaomi Mi Temperature and Humidity Monitor which is almost upsettingly cheaper than the ones I got earlier.

  Outside, the problem is the sweat washes the sun cream down the face into the mouth, and that stuff tastes bad and is probably bad to eat, which may be why people grow moustaches. Moustacheless, I've been preferring to wait for the cover of darkness before going outside.

- The phenomenon of content creators on TikTok holding their little lavalier microphones between finger and thumb, daintily, like they're giants holding full-sized microphones. I understand it â€“ they don't have lapels to clip them to, and to buy a whole new microphone would be a terrible waste. But they look a bit daft and hard-to-take-seriously, and I don't like how much it irritates me.

- ðŸ“º Amid a rewatch of <cite>The Thick of It</cite>. It's slightly interesting how poor the picture quality is in the early series.
