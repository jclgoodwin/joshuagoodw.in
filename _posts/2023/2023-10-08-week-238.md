- Edited with a pair of scissors, the label from a bottle of mint & tea tree shower gel can be reused to label a tin of peppermint tea bags. (Unless you have multiple kinds of mint tea, e.g. spear, which you need to distinguish between.)

  Incredible: just looking at the mint & tea tree shower gel website ([Aldi](https://groceries.aldi.co.uk/en-GB/p-lacura-kick-start-mint-tea-tree-shower-gel-250ml/4088600090658) or [original version](https://www.originalsource.co.uk/products/originals/mint-shower-gel/)), I swear I can smell mint. (I have a poor sense of smell; not being able to detect a gas leak is a concern. But everything's electric here, so it's probably more dangerous being colour blind and unable to see blood in poo.)

- Sunsets getting earlier means being frustrated by the limp crapness of the front light‚Äôs attachment to the bicycle ([‚Äúsecurely held in place‚Äù](https://www.cateye.com/intl/products/headlights/HL-EL084RC/#:~:text=securely%20held%20in%20place) my arse). Turns out I‚Äôve lost a little plastic [lock ring worth 99p](https://www.juliescycles.co.uk/shop/accessories/sub/lights/cateye-h34-bracket-replacement-lock-ring-5177/option/). So I've combed through various boxes of clutter, and gone to all the local Evanses Cycles and Sportses Direct to confirm that not everything listed on their websites is stocked in their shops ‚Äì a lot of vain bother just to try to avoid paying for delivery, but it's good to keep busy.

  (For a moment, I thought the aforelinked _Julie's Cycles_ did free delivery with no minimum order value! But taking advantage of poor Julie like that felt like a dick move ‚Äì there's nothing else I need to buy from them, and 99p can't be enough to cover the postage. And anyway, I was mistaken.) 

- Limescale. Cleaning influencers recommend citric acid ‚Äì in powdered form, not as it occurs in fruit ‚Äì as if it's a common thing everyone has in their cupboard. But it's not, it's hard to find in shops, worse than an Ottolenghi ingredient. Actually, [Wilko sold citric acid in their brilliant winemaking section](https://www.wilko.com/en-uk/wilko-citric-acid-50g/p/0022652), which I only realised eight minutes before the local Wilko closed forever, and eight minute cities have never been a thing.

  (Now it occurs to me that _Roys of Wroxham_ might have some ‚Äì they certainly sell huge bottles of vinegar which serve the same purpose ‚Äì so I'll try there.)

- Off the alcohol ‚Äì I wouldn't call it "Octsober" cos I'm not fundraising for charity and it was still September when I started. It's stopped me feeling so tired, which is nice.

- üì∫ <cite>Boiling Point</cite>, the four-part sequel to the stressful 2021 film, is intense and at times it's like being right there cutting onions. But the most astonishing part is seeing two different characters keep Marmite in the fridge.
