- Some work, which was all (three) different kinds of pointless time-wasting, but who can say if it was really pointless? I learnt some things along the way.

- ðŸ“– Wondered if I'd spotted an anachronism in <cite>My Year of Rest and Relaxation</cite>: someone recycles some yoghurt pots, pre-9/11, and I think of plastic recycling as being a post-9/11 thing, the 2003 Household Waste Recycling Act and all that. But actually folks have been recycling plastics, especially in New York, for longer than I thought.

  (Even if it was an anachronism, I think it would be OK, they should be allowed in works of fiction.)

- Continued to have a cold or infection or whatever. When I heard the news about David Cameron, I thought I was having a kind of fever-induced hallucination. 

  Sniffed some salty water [as instructed by the NHS](https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/non-allergic-rhinitis/#:~:text=How%20to%20clean%20your%20nose%20with%20a%20homemade%20salt%20water%20solution), which is kind of disgusting. Anyway, I feel mostly better now, thank you.

- Experienced some unusual anxiety about something stupid. But I appreciated how unusual it was, and there's something to be said for consolidating all your anxiety into one manageable feeling of unease.
