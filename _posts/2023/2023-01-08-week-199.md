- [The reviews](https://www.tesco.com/groceries/en-GB/products/290848285) are true, Tesco Chicken & Vegetable Soup (<span class="caps">chunky and classic</span>) (600g) is not nice soup.
  Bland, resistant to the effects of added seasoning, watery, not sure where it sits on the Bristol stool chart.
  I don't like being so negative, but it's bad soup, so at least I can save you the disappointment.
  Sad to think of the chickens and vegetables who gave their lives for _that_.

  (In fact, it looks like the online reviewers have given short shrift to all the Tesco fresh soups. What's going on there? I know we're more likely to review things we have strong opinions on, which skews the ratings, but it seems like Tesco's fresh soup product development team have really screwed the pooch.)

- Stepped on a bus for the first time under the [Â£2 fare cap](https://www.gov.uk/guidance/2-bus-fare-cap).
  It was fine, my main preoccupation was the engine so vibrating at idle that I imagined my teeth coming loose.
  They've been quietly installing tap on tap off hardware, which will speed up boarding when it's eventually switched on.
  The award-winning First Bus app is still selling some expensive network day tickets here for up to Â£14, which is a bit cheeky, maybe taking advantage of the information-poor â€“ I know there's _someone_ who'll make more than seven journeys in a day, but who?

- ðŸ“– [Tim Key](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=li1R80joLCw&t=242s)'s <cite>He Used Thought as a Wife</cite>. I'm not wild about the poems but it's not just poems. I keep misremembering the title as <cite>He Used Time as a Wife</cite>, silly me, that would be a different book entirely.

  In theory I could handle a book per week on average, like that terrible and boring YouTube man who dresses like he's at a funeral the whole time, oh I can't bear him. Sometimes the books would be shorter ones like [<cite>Alphonse, That Is Not OK to Do!</cite>](https://www.bbc.co.uk/iplayer/episode/b0b99ldk/cbeebies-bedtime-stories-636-matt-berry-alphonse-that-is-not-ok-to-do).

- ðŸ“º <cite>Happy Valley</cite>, oh lawks a lordy. Also [<cite>Search Party</cite>](https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/p0dlc2y6), well done to the BBC programme acquisition team.
