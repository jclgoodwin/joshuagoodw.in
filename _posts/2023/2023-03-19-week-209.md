- Big week for the [Irish bus data](https://www.boards.ie/discussion/2058288481/dublin-bus-go-ahead-bus-eireann-services-now-trackable-on-bustimes-org).
  It was more bother than expected, but nice to have a priority and bit of self-imposed urgency for a change. There remain teething problems, some route and trip IDs in the schedules and realtime data not matching perfectly, which I have every confidence will be solved.
  It's a tiny disappointment that the vehicle IDs are neither number plates nor fleet numbers but a secret third thing, but somehow enthusiastic people have already worked out which vehicles a lot of the numbers correspond to.

- Caught out in the rain, my coat started foaming â€“ the resolution to the Peterborough soap dispenser plot point from two weeks ago.

- Wildlife update: found something growing, maybe thriving, in the teapot.
  (Needless to say, not a big teapot user.)
