- Some work. I have a thing where people can type in a (UK) postcode to see what bus stops etc are near it. And it annoys me when those things demand an entire postcode, when the first few characters are sufficient to give a general gist of my location. But my own thing was guilty of the very thing I'm so annoyed by. Well, not anymore; adding the ability to search by just an "outcode", as those prefixes are called, was pleasingly nice.

  (Remember a quirk of the NHS COVID-19 app ... if the first four letters of your postcode were "NR1 1", it used to say you were in the "NR11" postcode district.)

  A slight complication I discovered a bit later: turns out some strings like E2 and [PE1](https://bustimes.org/search?q=pe1#services) are both valid postcode outcodes _and_ bus route numbers.

  (Is that all this week? Pathetic.)

- My recflective bicycling jacket is so good at reflecting light that it activates those infrared sensors from a great distance ‚Äì you know, the ‚Äútouch free exit‚Äù buttons some buildings have, and [the flushes of posh public toilets](https://www.uk.roca.com/rocalife/discover-our-toilet-flush-sensor-plates).
  I can tell you it‚Äôs annoying when a toilet flushes when you don‚Äôt want it to.
  In the loos at Waitrose, I stood at a urinal and my shiny coat turned on the taps across the room like there was a poltergeist about. (The sound of running water can make you want to pee, and what better place for it?)

  But only certain parts of the lurid blouson are mirror-like enough; I need to work on the choreography of exiting this building so the door appears to open itself without my so much as looking at the door release button.

- Out to <cite>RHLSTP</cite> two evenings on the trot. As expected, the Joe Pasquale episode was remarkable, will go down in history, etc. Another highlight was leaving the room for a wee ‚Äì partly thanks to the sound of rain on the theatre's roof ‚Äì and returning just as everyone was applauding the end of the first half.

  üçû A few loaves have had an amusing air bubble in their crust, bulgy like a snake who's swallowed a golf ball. (Pictured, with some damage from being extracted from the tin.) It's unusual and I like it, but it's really a sign of under-worked/under-proven dough, so I must do better.

  This week I made an [apple cake](https://www.bbc.co.uk/food/recipes/dorset_apple_cake_37804 "played fast and loose with the flours"), the sort of cake that's better the next day. And in the process I dropped my telephone on the floor and cracked the screen, which was unfortunate, but still I had an apple cake.
