- Spent some of the week in the East Midlands, and why not.

  - Saw Stewart Lee’s [Tornado/Snowflake](https://www.stewartlee.co.uk/snowflake-tornado/).
    It looks increasingly like Lee, the large comedian, has simply eaten the other comedians.
    Anyway, I recommend it.

    - Lee said something about fellow comedian Josh Widdecombe,
      which reminded me about [Widdecombe claiming Argos Extra is a smaller version of an Argos shop](https://iamjamesward.com/2011/09/09/argos-extra/),
      “the rare definition of ‘extra’”.
      (Of course, Argos Extra is a larger version of an Argos shop, exactly as the name suggests.)
      A couple of years after reading that blog post, I saw Widdecombe live repeating the lie,
      and I’m afraid I was too shocked to yell out to challenge it.

  - Saw Josie Long's [Tender](https://josielong.seetickets.com/tour/josie-long), which was nice.

  - And it was nice to see some of the East Midlands in some detail. Impressed by the cleanliness and efficiency of the Nottingham City Transport buses. Impressed by the stylishness of the Trent Barton buses.

- Some other things. I don't know.
