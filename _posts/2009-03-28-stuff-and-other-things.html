title: Stuff, and other things
---

<p>It&#8217;s Thursday morning. I tumble downstairs, and head straight to the toilet. It&#8217;s the only way to start the day, in my opinion, although readers may have their own preferred methods. (What do <em>you</em> think? <em>Leave a comment!</em> I <em>really</em> care.)</p>
<p>Standing next to the toilet, I unscrew the lid of a bottle. I drop the lid.</p>
<p>I know what you&#8217;re thinking. You&#8217;re thinking I drop the lid in the toilet. Well, you&#8217;re wrong &#8211; it lands on the floor. Ha! I fooled you.</p>
<p>I bend down to pick it up, thankful that I have not had to engage in the unappetising task of fishing a bit of plastic out of a low-level sea of horrible water.</p>
<p>It is a stroke of luck. The gods, I decide, have been huddling together up in the clouds, and they have decided to be kind to me. I make a mental note to sacrifice the next goat I meet, in their honour &#8211; just a small token of gratitude towards the lovely gods.</p>
<p>Then I head to the bathroom. I catch my reflection in the mirror (which, as remarkably as ever, fails to break). I notice that my hair &#8211; which I washed the previous night, to mark the fact that I will be standing for a few moments in front of a camera &#8211; is sticking up at the back, a scar from the apparently unusual positions into which I contorted myself during the night&#8217;s sleep. No matter how much I pat it down, it refuses to cooperate. I am forced to give the hair a splash of water to get it looking as presentable as possible, but this does not have a huge effect.</p>
<p>I am distraught. I had thought that the gods, were being nice to me. But no &#8211; the wretched rotters, the fucking fuckers, had decided to punish me, by making my hair resemble, for want of a better analogy, a duck&#8217;s bum. And on the one day when the state of my hair mattered a bit more than usual. Stuff that goat massacre idea.</p>
<p>Luckily it was raining outside. As I waited for the bus, my hair flattened down nicely as the bits of cloud showered me. </p>
<p>Then it emerged that no, I needn&#8217;t have worried, because I wasn&#8217;t going to be standing around in front of a camera after all. All that getting wet and patting of hair for nothing. They&#8217;re definitely not getting any goat slaughters out of me. <a href="/acting-the-goat">I like goats.</a></p>
<p>Yesterday, I found myself exercising. I puffed and panted like something that puffs and pants like Joshua Camille Lee Goodwin when he is exercising. Best of all, I got to pseudo-shout menacingly at fellow exercisers. &#8220;Hurry up. No slacking. <span class="caps">You&#8217;re slowing down</span>! I had never used the word &#8220;slacking&#8221; before. It wasn&#8217;t quite the religious experience I had hoped it was going to be, but I&#8217;m not too angry about that..</p>
<p>I thought that this situation could inspire an unoriginal and bad, and therefore very good, idea for a character in some sitcom or sketch show &#8211; a sporty coach trainer person dude guy, who happens to be extremely unfit and blubbersome (unlike me, I feel compelled to point out). I bet someone&#8217;s already done that though. Probably those wretche <a href="http://michaelleggesblog.wordpress.com/2009/03/11/little-wise/">Gordon Corden and Jordan Gordon</a> fellows, or whatever they&#8217;re called, have done it. Whatever.</p>
<p>Yesterday, I also paid witness to a nose with some sort of dried snot dangling out of it. It look rather like some short-sighted chef had mistaken the olfactory organ for a potato, or a shepherds&#8217; pie, and sprinkled a bit of cheese all over it and popped it under the grille for a few hours. A presto. Delia would approve.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, it was not a potato. It was a nose. A disgusting nose, in serious need of a tissue. It made me feel a little queasy. In fact, I think I want a potato, with some cheese on it. Now!</p>
<p>Don&#8217;t worry. Tomorrow, something other than a mundane diary-type thing &#8211; the start of another great series. It&#8217;s going to taste <em>great</em>, as the Tamil Tigers should have said. Maybe even creamy. <em>Don&#8217;t go away</em>, as Chris Tarrant said.</p>
