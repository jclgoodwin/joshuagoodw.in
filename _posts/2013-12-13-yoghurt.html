<p>There was <a href="http://www.newyorker.com/reporting/2013/11/04/131104fa_fact_mead">something in the <cite>New Yorker</cite> about Grecian yoghurt</a> the other week. Specifically, about the Chobani brand, which we&#8217;re told has been kicking Fage and other rivals&#8217; bottoms quite comprehensively in the much&#8211;written-about <a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=greek+yogurt+war">Greek yoghurt wars</a>.</p>
<blockquote><p>How an immigrant from Turkey turned Greek yogurt into an American snack food.</p></blockquote>
<p>It had some of the characteristics of a &#8220;puff piece&#8221;, and in fact elsewhere in the magazine was a full-page advertisement for Chobani. The plot thickens! (Thickens, yes, much what like yoghurt does when it is strained in the Greek style.)</p>
<p>When I found myself in a shop a bit later, something made me notice the pots of Chobani&#8217;s Greek yoghurt &#8211; I think they&#8217;re new to British shelves &#8211; and before I knew it I was ponying up all the money to buy one.</p>
<p>Unlike the plain Fage yoghurt you get here &#8211; which only someone entirely perverse, or <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KTmh0h8O0T8&#038;t=3m26s">Richard Wilson&#8217;s character in <cite>Tutti Frutti</cite></a>, would eat on its own, but which can be a creamy and refreshing companion to some fruit sold separately &#8211; Chobani&#8217;s is all adulterated with fruit and sugar. I think mine involved blueberries, and sadly it was a bit too sweet.</p>
<p>One effect of this oversweetness is that it&#8217;s only really stomachable in small mouthfuls. Maybe that&#8217;s a good thing, because it discourages greediness &#8211; a small spoonful mixed into one&#8217;s morning muesli is quite enough, thank you. But the strong yoghurtiness of plain yoghurt has the same effect, even though stuffing one&#8217;s face with that has slightly less severe tooth-rotting consequences.  It&#8217;s nice that the sugar is cane sugar, and the fruit is all genuine fruit, but Chobani&#8217;s talk of &#8220;naturally sourced ingredients&#8221; smells a bit unsubstantial.</p>

<p>A more recent issue of the <cite>New Yorker</cite> has <a href="http://www.newyorker.com/reporting/2013/12/02/131202fa_fact_trillin">some blather about mozzarella</a>. What can explain this sudden obsession with lactose? After being brainwashed once by the fancy magazine, and feeling the egg on my face, I won&#8217;t make the same mistake again.</p>
