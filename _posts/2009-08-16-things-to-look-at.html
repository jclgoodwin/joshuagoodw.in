title: Things to look at

<p>You know those frightful people who insist on showing off their holiday photographs, making you feel both very bored and slightly jealous? Me neither. But I&#8217;m one of them.</p>
<p>I present to you just four of my snaps. There are more, and some of them are decent too, but I am limited by being a little bit anxious about people&#8217;s faces appearing here, not wanting to display several photographs of the same thing, my slightly broken SD card, and other things. Four is more than enough &#8211; well, it is for the time being, anyhow. It is certainly the case that I&#8217;m a bit weird, filling my blog with photographs taken using a sweat-cheap and increasingly-broken Tesco camera.</p>

<p>One jolly evening was spent playing games, eating burnt meat, and singing songs by Robert Allen Zimmerman (Google him &#8211; he&#8217;s more famous than you think).</p>

<p>I can&#8217;t bear dogs. So naturally, there was a dog staying with us. Now I can bear dogs a bit more. This one was a bit mad, and ate plastic. In fact, screw the past tense, I&#8217;m sure he still is a bit mad. But probably less mad now &#8211; a decline perhaps partially down to our influence.</p>

<p>Relevant stuff that&#8217;s coming up: some grainy YouTube cinematography, and some mundane anecdotes. Irrelevant stuff that&#8217;s coming up: everything else. Don&#8217;t worry, I&#8217;ll try to stop this from being too much of a non-stop travelogue. I do do other things. For example&#8230; well, I&#8217;m not going to tell you, because telling you would ruin the surprise.</p>
