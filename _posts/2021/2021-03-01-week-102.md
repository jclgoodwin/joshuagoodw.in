- Went to collect some food from a takeaway establishment, as a treat. Spice something.
  Thought I'd try one of the lower-end players in the competitive arena.
  They had never heard of me.
  It turned out I'd gone to the wrong Spice something, gotten my Valleys and Lounges etc mixed up. Cool story.

- Jabbed with the Pfizer. (Pfized?) It was terrifically efficient, great service design.
  After a day, my arm is a tiny bit tender where the needle went in – it's a shame I didn't think more carefully about which arm – what side you sleep on might matter more than handedness.

  There was a dude sponging down each chair after it had been used, which is a bit of silly bother but oh well, if it makes people feel better then why not,
  and if it turns out the virus does transmit from trouser to trouser it won't seem so silly.
  More importantly, needless to say, all the windows of the building were open etc.
  And my bum sometimes gets sweaty, which leaves patches on seats, so I should be celebrating the normalisation of seat wiping.

- Almost at the end of <cite>Better Call Saul</cite>. Operating a drugs cartel looks like such a palaver.

- Big up the 70s lady rock band Fanny. Maybe the name, or maybe the patriarchy, limited their commercial success.
