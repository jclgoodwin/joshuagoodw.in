title: Apples, windows, and raincoats
---

<p>The other day, I instructed my army of often-lazy bionic potato slaves to trawl the internet for some hot pictures of staples.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, bionic potato slaves are often lazy. (I might have already mentioned that, sorry, but being lazy my bionic potato slaves will not check to see whether I have.) As well as the thing in parentheses, the lethargy of my starchy minions means that they did not carry out my order, and I had to go to the trouble of looking for some staple pictures myself. Oh, sometimes I wonder why I bother having an army of bionic potato slaves.</p>
<p>But the potatoes managed to redeem themselves, by both photographing a paper-clip and drawing my attention to <a href="http://www.upstartblogger.com/free-dell-laptops-for-mac-and-linux-bloggers">some article</a> that some guy wrote on <a href="http://www.upstartblogger.com/">some blog</a> some time ago. It&#8217;s at times like this that I realise why I have my gang of mutant tuberous crops.</p>
<p>According to the article, a blogger like this one can get himself a Dell laptop for free. That&#8217;s magic!</p>
<p>But there is a mild catch. A mild one, but a catch nonetheless. A catch that can be caught my reading the following quotation.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>After all, they have apparently chosen me since I am vocal about being an Apple user, and to a lesser extent a Linux user.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Time to get vocal.</p>
<p>I quite like apples. They&#8217;re nice and crunchy, and a bit less impractically juicy than mangoes and oranges and nectarines and peaches are. There isn&#8217;t an annoying musician&#8217;s offspring named Apples. I especially like russets &#8211; they&#8217;re my favourite variety, far tastier than the tasteless spheres of shiny, polished, flaky horribleness obtainable from most supermarkets. But of course, they&#8217;re not bad either. Just not quite so amazingly brilliant.</p>
<p>I must admit that, being currently fitted with some orthodontic thingamabobs as <a href="/teeth">I am</a>, apples are a bit hard to bite into. Perhaps testing out a shiny portable computing device might fully open up my eyes to this problem with apples. But right now, I can use a knife to chop the apple up into sufficiently small pieces for my brace-clad teeth to wrestle with, and I do very much like to support the knife industry. British knives for British apples, or something along those lines.</p>
<p>I notice that Mashley Organ mentions being a <em>user</em> of apples. And, I have to say, apples are very useful too. For instance, I once played a game of football with an apple. You could also play tennis, or . Sounds ambitious, but certainly a little crab apple would be perfect for playing a spot of whiff-whaff.</p>
<p>Aren&#8217;t windows rubbish? What do you do with windows? You look out of them, that&#8217;s what. Rubbish. Why do you want to look out of the window? Why do you want to see what&#8217;s outside? What&#8217;s outside? Birds? Who wants to look at birds? You&#8217;ll probably end up getting the sun in your eyes. And half of the time</p>
<p>Windows are nothing more than a magnet for yobs. Pervy wanker yobs who want to cop an eyeful of the sight of you getting dressed, and frustrated yobs who want to hurl bricks and eggs.</p>
<p>If you&#8217;re wearing a macintosh, then it doesn&#8217;t matter if a yob hurls an egg at you. Same if it rains. What&#8217;s more, macs tend to be brightly-coloured, which can lead to visibility at night time. If you tried to use a window to increase your visibility when </p>
<p>I suppose a window is useful if you have locked the door and left the key inside. You can climb through the window. I did that once. But yobs could do the same, and climb through the windows of your house &#8211; perhaps, shockingly, <em>to steal some carrots</em>! Nobody wants their carrots to get stolen. Windows are nothing other than pure evil, I conclude, if their presence is likely to result in root vegetable theft. </p>
<p>So, Dell, can&#8217;t you see that I prefer apples and macintoshes to windows? If you can&#8217;t, I suggest that you get your eyes tested. And once you&#8217;ve done so, you will know what to do. Remember to wear your new glasses, so that you definitely use a postage stamp rather than some other nonâ€“postage stamp thing that one might confuse for one. (I couldn&#8217;t think of any examples, and <a href="http://twitter.com/hairyegg/status/1285112941">nor could those lazy buttmunches on Twitter</a>, unfortunately, but never mind all that.)</p>
<p>I will await the courier with anticipation. On the other hand, I could always just go to Argos.</p>
