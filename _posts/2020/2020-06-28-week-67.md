- It has been warm. I'm a sweaty little man, but that's just a failing of my glands, and it's bad form to complain about it being warm.

- Lots of traffic about. I can believe that it's still less than usual, but I've looking back and forth along the queues of motor cars at the traffic lights in campy disbelief, like, _where are you all going_. I also glared at a driver I saw fiddling with his mobile phone.

- Some cycling. Went quite a long way to see my da, and explored some of the off-road cycle paths ‚Äì they're quite good, aren't they.

- Time for some observations about the novelty of living near a football stadium where, finally, some matches have been played.

  - I walked past Martin Keown. He hadn't donned his mandatory mask yet ‚Äì not sure I'd've recognised him if he had ‚Äì but, even so, I wasn't completely sure it was Martin Keown until, later, I searched Twitter to see people complaining about Martin Keown's punditry. 

  - Yesterday, there was a drone buzzing about overhead. This meant I could tune into the BBC and see that the Morrisons car park was empty so I wouldn't need to queue to buy tomato juice.

  - Some fans gathered to watch the team coaches (more coaches than usual, for distancing, I think) arrive and depart. Clearly they, like me, were excited by the Van Hool Astromegas, Mercedes-Benz Tourismos and Plaxton Elite is, not the famous masked athlete passengers.

- üòç Liverpool.
