- To London, achievement city. That was OK. Went to Slough and Reading as well, but at this point I'm just listing places. Missed a train, which has been a recurring theme in all the previous few weeks I've used trains, although I've not always deigned to mention it here â€“ but then I was fabulously early for the train home, like a sensible person. Cool story.

- [<cite>The Trip to Greece</cite>](https://www.comedy.co.uk/tv/the_trip/episodes/4/). It's not _really_ _funny_ but I watched it all and it was nice to watch what in some ways is a grand Range Rover advert. I have some complaints about the Now TV app, but is this the place for them?
