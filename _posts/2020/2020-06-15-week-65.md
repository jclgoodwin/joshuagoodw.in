- Crivens.

- I had a life affirming rabbit curry. You might think "Deliveroo" is a service purely for the delivery of food make from Winnie-the-Pooh's friends, were they going to call it Kangaliver, but it came via a different unicorn.

  I have some complaints about their weirdly bad handling of addresses and postcodes and things. Hmm.

- Less jetlagged. Going to sleep when it's dark, like a person.

- For weeks, I'd been looking forward to seeing some rail replacement buses and coaches, and sure enough I did, and took some photographs. How wholesome.

- Finished watching <cite>Law & Order UK</cite>, by which I don't mean I've watched all of it at all – I skipped past some series, and it was a relief when the smug guy got replaced by a different smug guy – and it's a bit bootlicky.
