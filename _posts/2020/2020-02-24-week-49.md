A week in, mostly, North England, which is a completely normal name for that geographical area.

York, where I was all "I remember when this was all fields", not just about carbuncular new buildings but also about [fields that have temporarily become lakes](https://www.yorkpress.co.uk/news/18242631.knavesmire-becomes-lake-wake-storm-dennis/). Some places that one can get to from York, such as Harrogate, with all its wealth, and Ripon, which felt more down-at-heel because it was raining. Then Liverpool, the pool of life.

[Martin Belam wrote about League Two away matches](https://martinbelam.com/2020/alone-in-a-crowd/) and the joy of going to thereof. Which resonates, and is sort of how I spent much of the week (minus the League Two matches).

A needlessly complicated and expensive journey home, but one of the upshots of that was experiencing [one of the new excel buses](https://busandtrainuser.com/2020/02/17/excel-excels/). They look shockingly wonderful – shiny and red outside, pretend wood and real leather inside – but I found the ride uncomfortably firm, and something was rattling noisily. Well, maybe I was unlucky to get a rattly one, and maybe I was unusually jaded.

Did some work, mainly on the train. I'll probably do some more work next week, not on any trains. Good week.
