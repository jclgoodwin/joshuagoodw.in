- The evening is a good time to go to the supermarket – no queue, fewer people dithering about yoghurt.

- Walking to Lidl, I encountered several steaming folks who must be having a tough time. That was a bit sad.

- I have a bicycle again. As previously mentioned, hooray, and think I've been lucky to find an adequate one. I have some complaints about the bicycle storage here – the motor cars get much more, better sheltered space, which their drivers don't have to lift their cars onto – even the bins are better located – but is this the place for those complaints?

- I have partaken of some Chinese meal deliveries. I heard that unconcious racism means Chinese businesses are particularly struggling, and I live downhill, and give a bigger than average tip (based on what I've learned from [r/Deliveroos](https://www.reddit.com/r/deliveroos/)), so it feels like a good thing to do. But the food hasn't been that amazing, and it's expensive. Hmm.

- Unforgivably, Dominic Cummings uses the word "blog" when he means "blog post".

  I was also going to mention that he appeared to have a Tesco bag for life in the recycling bin outside his house, but it turns out that [Islington Council says you can recycle plastic bags](https://www.islington.gov.uk/recycling-and-rubbish/recycling/mixed-recycling/plastic-packaging), so that's OK.
