- I was making bread, sometimes sourdough, "before it was cool". It's not that difficult. I made some "this week", which was fine, and I'll make some more _this_ week, cool story.

	Adrian "Toby jug of hot piss" Chiles, who is a broadcaster whose work I enjoy, [has shared his soda bread recipe](https://www.theguardian.com/food/commentisfree/2020/apr/01/shoppers-hoard-yeast-solution-soda-bread) and [his sourdough experiences](https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/apr/08/coronavirus-crisis-loaf-bread-sourdough-bake-off-flour-yeast-lockdown), in response to a supposed shortage of dried yeast. I'm tempted to try Chiles's soda bread recipe, simply because "Adrian Chiles's soda bread recipe" is a fun idea, just like [Julia Sawalha's hummus, Rory Bremner's orange soufflé](https://www.bbc.co.uk/food/programmes/b00701fw/episodes), etc.

- I have [a robot vacuum cleaner](https://www.amazon.co.uk/Eufy-BoostIQ-Super-Thin-Self-Charging-Medium-Pile/dp/B07BFP9TNH?tag=joshgood-21) now.

	- For reasons, I got it delivered to the "Amazon PopUp" in the Morrisons cafe, which is apparently now a thing – indeed, there's a sign up outside the repurposed cafe, but after waiting til the appointed opening hour I found no staff on either of my visits, which is explicable by their maybe having more important work to do. Eventually I spotted an Amazon cardboard box, and sure enough it had my name on it, so I just took it ... which was thrilling. As there was no way for it to be marked as "collected", I've since been emailed a reminder to collect the parcel – "If you can't collect your parcel, it will be returned for a full refund"
    – and it would be unfortunate if this means I've accidentally done a crime.

    - The wandering overlord is providing hours of entertainment. It's not an actual Roomba, which is the Hoover of robot vacuum cleaners and a character in <cite>Breaking Bad</cite>, <cite>Parks & Recreation</cite> and <cite>Jonathan Creek</cite> – it's a cheaper sort, and doesn't even have an app or Wi-Fi, which I suppose is for the best because I don't want it to be recruited to fight in some cyber war.

    - I've met vacuum cleaners before, so I'm not surprised by the surprising amount of dust, but I am surprised by all the hair it's picked up – presumably that of the people who used to live here – yuck – which inspired me to remove a mound of their hair from the washbasin plughole, a satisfying treat.

 Stay safe.
