title: The Weakest Link

<p>I have recreated the sound of the beginning of <cite>The Weakest Link</cite>:</p>
<p><object id="audioplayer1" type="application/x-shockwave-flash" data="/wp/wp-content/plugins/playpress/player.swf" width="290" height="24">
<param name="movie" value="/wp/wp-content/plugins/playpress/player.swf" />
<param name="FlashVars" value="soundFile=/media/weakestlink.mp3&amp;playerID=1" />
<param name="quality" value="high" />
<param name="menu" value="false" />
<param name="wmode" value="opaque" /><audio controls preload="metadata" src="/media/weakestlink.mp3"><a href="/media/weakestlink.mp3">Download audio file (weakestlink.mp3)</a></audio></object></p>
<p>You see, the man whose disembodied male voice appears in the teatime quiz programme is the same man on whose voice is based the electronic voice of my iPod. That&#8217;s what I was getting at there.</p>
<p>I am furious that he emphasises the wrong parts of &#8220;Bowie&#8221; all wrong, but such limitations also serve as a comforting reminder that the machines aren&#8217;t ready to take over just yet. When that changes, I think we should start to worry.</p>
