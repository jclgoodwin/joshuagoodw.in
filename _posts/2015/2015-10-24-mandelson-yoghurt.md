[Michael Hogan, the <cite>Telegraph</cite>][telegraph]:

> [Mark] Gatiss mimes Mandelson spooning yogurt into his mouth. “There’s this

(Gatiss mentions it again [in an interview in the <cite>Independent</cite>][independent].)

What is it about Mandelson and yoghurt? There is another story, from 2008,
[which the <cite>Daily Mail</cite> has][mail]. A bit like 
[what John Selwyn Gummer's daughter did with some beef][gummer], Mandelson
"gulped a glass of Chinese yoghurt" to show confidence in Chinese dairy
products after a food safety incident. "I shall continue drinking my favourite
milk product, which I enjoy and which does not make me nervous." Ten days
later, Mandelson just so happened to become poorly with kidney stones, which
might or might not have been caused by his lactose-based stunt.
