- I couldn't watch a whole episode, but I've been finding myself watching clips of <i>Dragons' Den</i>, the programme where small entrepreneurs pitch to "dragons" who are some fellows who have lots of money. ([It's a bad title](https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2005/jan/08/screenburn.features16 "dragons don't have dens, they have lairs, dammit"), but worse some international versions are called <i>Shark Tank</i> – sharks aren't even known for hoarding gold and stuff like dragons are.) Over the years, they seem to feature fewer wacky inventions – there was a device for keeping half-used cucumbers fresh, which the rich investors sneered at because a cucumber is a trifling expense to them – and these days it's more stuff like two ex-bankers have started an ethical jam subscription service.

- To Edinburgh. An unfortunately long train journey, mostly spent in various vestibules, but I don't mind a vestibule. Waiting at Peterborough, I realised I'd forgotten an important charging cable, and thought I might have to buy one from Marks & Spencer – paying over the odds for a luxury cable enrobed in Belgian chocolate – but instead I found a very reasonably priced one at Flying Tiger Copenhagen. Moments later, I realised I hadn't forgotten the cable after all, so now I had a surfeit of cables – what a funny story.

  I haven't been to any festival/fringe things, nor to an Oasis concert. (Respect to the tourist tat shops that usually sell tartan wigs, who've have pivoted to selling Oasis T-shirts.)
