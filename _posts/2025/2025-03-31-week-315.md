- Gave myself a haircut, and gave the (bustimes.org) website a sort of one too. The urge sneaks up on you and the lead time for appointment-only hairdressers is too long, although yes I know plenty of barbershops allow walk-ins – one I saw had illustrated this with a picture of Christopher Walken, but I can't remember if the text beneath read "Walkens welcome" or "no Walkens".

  In the following days, I found and snipped some wisps of hair that had escaped the buzz of the electric clippers, and similarly there were bits of website that needed further attention to look right depending on the size of the viewport and the content.

- Roll on April: not only is it the start of a new financial year, but it's permission to turn the page on the calendar on the wall. So is every month, but this month I tried to erase something I'd pencilled in and the rubber made a terrible smear over the middle of month, and I'm looking forward to not having to look at it any more. (I just peeked at April and, troublingly, the picture – it's [the <i>Buses</i> magazine calendar](https://www.ebay.co.uk/itm/196108558853), so it's a picture of a Duple Dominant II–bodied 1982 Leyland Tiger – has acted as a sort of carbon paper, leaving a faint carbon copy of the month before's appointments – mainly where I've ticked off each _sans cans_ day of Lent<!-- (which, by the way, is 46 days long, what a swizz) -->.)
