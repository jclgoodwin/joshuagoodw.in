- [AirPods bleep](/2024/11/week-295) follow-up:
  Apple has [acknowledged the “quiet chime”](https://www.macrumors.com/2025/01/09/airpods-pro-chime-sound/).
  I briefly wondered whether disabling some nannying hearing protection feature or other would stop them making that sound, but
  a) it’s not a thing,
  b) I want my hearing protected thank you, and
  c) if the sound went away now I’d feel a sense of loss, like an egg without salt.

- It still hasn’t snowed here, but the frost does just as good a job of making the landscape look pretty and the ground so satisfyingly crunchy.

  The temperature. In theory, I can programme a heating schedule for each heating zone (room), for each half-hour of each day of the week. In practice, that feature of the _4 zone wall mounted pilot wire controller_ doesn't work – I think I damaged the delicate electronics [last year](/2024/05/week-268) – and even when it did work I was too thick to programme it, so I manually micromanage the heaters instead. I'm just grateful to be warm, and the display of the controller still serves as a handy digital clock.
