- Woke up silently humming a tune, but before I could put words to it it was forgotten like all the fantastic ideas I've had while on the threshold of falling asleep.

- ðŸŽ¦ <i>Nosferatu</i> (2024).
  I'll level with you,
  I did some microsleeps,
  which is not to say the film was soothing and viscera-free,
  it had more to do with the beer and fish I'd enjoyed earlier â€“ the problem with the Belgians is they don't have a word for "keep it session".
  Also I was distracted by [trying to remember](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tip_of_the_tongue) Willem Dafoe's name. 

- Took in [Celya AB](https://www.celya-ab.com/)'s show at the regional arts centre. She mentioned each joke costing 17p, assuming a ticket price of ~Â£17, but somehow I'd only paid Â£14 which is even better value.

- Rewatching the first serie of <i>Severance</i> before I catch up with the second, and I'm glad I decided to because it's remarkable how much I don't remember, it's like it was a different version of me watching it.

  (Yes, I keep trying to make the singular "serie" happen, because "season" feels like a beneath-me Americanism. Likewise, it feels wrong for an Englishman to describe anything as "[the] OG", like someone from Tacolneston saying "y'all".)

- Shaved my face for the first time this year, and I'm not sure about the slug-like expanse that it's uncovered, hmm.
