- Obviously I condemn "map porn", which objectifies maps and gives young people an unrealistic expectation of maps, but it was nice that some screenshots of bustimes.org appeared on [a subreddit by that name](https://www.reddit.com/r/MapPorn/comments/1oteg32/the_colour_of_buses_across_great_britain/) and later other social media things that nick content from there, and finally [a video by the latest big YouTuber I'd never heard of](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jml4VUS3bEA&t=59s). "Who put this together it must've took them ages" ... you have no idea.

- Since I'm of exactly average height, and assuming that my legs and torso are in proportion, urinals are exactly the correct height for me. But what do I do with this enormous privilege? I usually go into a cubicle.

- I tootled to London yet again to watch a RHLSTP, which led to that thought about urinals. And I had a halloumi wrap and didn't leave any of my belongings on the train.
