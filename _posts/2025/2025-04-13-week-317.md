- One of the best things about the bubble of AI bollocks is the aggressiveness of the crawlers they use to steal content to “train” their models, and yet some of us have the temerity to complain about them [generously load-testing our websites for free](https://adactio.com/journal/21831).

  For a while I was using `robots.txt` to discourage these creeps from scraping my things, but it dawned on me that a more effective sabotage is actually to let them crawl as much of my useless rubbish as they like, and it's arrogant to think otherwise.

- A long weekend in Folkestone. Lovely, but maybe the splendid weather is skewing my judgment.

  Somewhat illogically, caught [the number 10 bus from Ashford](https://bustimes.org/services/10-folkestone-ashford), a slow meander that I warmly recommend.

  The hotel. There's a sea view! I didn't pay for a sea view, so I can't complain that it's a sea view obscured by bird shit and blown double glazing.
  They serve breakfast cereal out of hoppers, so [it can't be a Top Class Hotel](https://joshuagoodw.in/2024/01/week-253). At least some of the money they've saved by not updating the decor for 40 years has been passed on to the consumer in the form of lower prices.

- Joan as Police Woman (Folkestone Quarterhouse). Not quite worth going to Folkestone for, but Folkestone was worth going to Folkestone for.
