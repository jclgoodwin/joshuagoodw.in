- This weather of ours. I think my scalp is a bit sunburnt. I wouldn't mind a bit of rain, to wash the bird poo off the balcony.

- Some work. A trying week down the data mine, but there were some wins.

  - Waffling about maps. I succeeded in getting [tileserver-gl-light](https://github.com/maptiler/tileserver-gl) to serve some Ordnance Survey Open Zoomstack data, well done me.

  - Got invited to the FlixBus affiliate programme at last, and I hope I'm not betraying any confidences by revealing my earnings so far – on people clicking through [from bustimes.org](https://bustimes.org/operators/flixbus) and buying tickets – total 22p. Their tickets are such good value that the commision doesn't amount to much, but the money is welcome after I lost 10p betting on the wrong pope.

    I know I complained about FlixBus recently, but in my experience their drivers get lost infinitely less often than Megabus drivers do. (Yes I know there's really no such thing as a FlixBus driver or a Megabus driver, they're all employed by subcontractors.) And on a previous, crowded journey, the size and proximity of the vast lady who sat next to me was, I gather, tantamount to something some men pay a lot of money to experience.
