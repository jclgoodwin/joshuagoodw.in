- Got a mattress topper.
  Some say that trying to fix a clapped-out, sunken mattress with a mattress topper is like putting lipstick on a pig; they might be useful if your mattress is too firm, but they're not magic. But I've been sleeping slightly better since I garnished the old mattress with the new topper, and who can say it's not a coincidence?

- Solstices and equinoxes are up there with April Fools' Day as, I don't know, apposite days for launching things. In particular, I thought I'd add a button to bustimes.org for more easily switching between the light and dark themes, which actually no one's been crying out for. But usually I'm too impatient to keep things up my sleeve until a special date, and this time the solstice just whooshed by.

- Good news: for once, the filling of my mince pies didn't really bubble over. But the pastry looks a bit pallid and underdone.
