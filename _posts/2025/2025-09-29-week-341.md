- Some work. The coordinates (49.766807, -7.557159) crop up from time to time – there's a bus stop in Leicestershire there, sometimes served by Edinburgh trams and buses – and I've only just noticed why. It's a location west and a bit south of the Isles of Scilly, and it's the false origin of the Ordnance Survey British National Grid, [what some are calling](https://gis.stackexchange.com/questions/456475/importing-latitude-and-longitude-data-for-uk#comment745264_456475) the British Null Island.

  (For a while there was a weather buoy at Null Island [where the equator meets the prime meridian]. Could we put a little something, an upside-down nylon flag, at "our" equivalent?)

  For some time I've been puzzled by the coordinates in [Highland Council Buses' "network data"](https://data.discoverpassenger.com/operator/highlandcouncilbuses#:~:text=Network%20Data), coordinates like (0.843686, 0.265425). Today I finally realised that they're eastings and northings, from off of the aforementioned grid, but divided by 1,000,000, of course they are.

- My back has become itchy. I think it's acne or "bacne" – it's aberrantly hairy back there – or a reaction to some different laundry detergent, but I _slightly_ worried that it might be bedbugs. There's no evidence of bedbugs, but just in case I the-opposite-of-postponed (fast-tracked?) the changing and washing of some bedding, not that it would make any difference. Isn't it interesting that there are many more synonyms for "postpone" than for the opposite.
