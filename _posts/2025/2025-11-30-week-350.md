- Last week I took a photo to illustrate the Wikipedia article about the [Apple Polishing Cloth](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_Polishing_Cloth).
  I have an Apple Polishing Cloth, but it was grubby despite my washing it, so ridiculously I spent another £19 just for the photo. (Yes, given the exchange rate and that it costs $19, it should cost fewer pounds.) But perhaps I can resell it – would you pay extra to own the thing that’s in the photo on the Wikipedia article about the thing? <!-- I’d have to donate the profits to Wikipedia of course. -->

  (It’s not a very good cloth. A bit of old T-shirt or pants will do just as well.)

- The Acquired podcast is a business podcast about business things. It can be [infuriating, galling and partial](https://www.russelldavies.com/typepad/russelldavies.typepad.com/planning/2025/04/acquired-on-epic-systems.html) but I’ve been listening to it a bit.

  - They had an episode where they interviewed Sam Bankman-Fried before all the fraud he was doing became known.
    To their credit, it’s still [available to listen to](https://www.acquired.fm/episodes/ftx-with-sam-bankman-fried-mario-gabriele), but it’s pretty boring.
    The biggest red flag is the appalling sound quality – remarkable that a then-billionaire wouldn’t have a better audio recording setup.

  - The four-hour [episode on Coca-Cola](https://www.acquired.fm/episodes/coca-cola) didn’t touch on two of the three things I know about the history of the fizzy pop: [the Peckham Spring fiasco](http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/business/3809539.stm), and the 7.5 cent coin and the "official blank" that were mooted to solve the problems with vending machines that made it hard to raise the price for [a long time](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fixed_price_of_Coca-Cola_from_1886_to_1959).

- CMAT (h). Having arrived late, and then dithered at the bar – the local venue no longer has any astringent local cider on tap – I resigned myself to spending the evening with a concrete pillar in my face. But then the Dunboyne Diana herself appeared not on the faraway stage but on a fellow's shoulders just the other side of the pillar, so that was cool.
