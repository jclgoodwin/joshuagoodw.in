- Had some dandruff. I'm not sure I've ever had dandruff before, and at first I wasn't convinced I had this time â€“ surely it was flakes of ceiling landing on me, coincidentally whenever I touched my hair. After just one wash with Head & Shoulders it's much better, and it serves me right for being disloyal and sometimes using Herbal Essences. (I'm going to look into plastic-free solid shampoo bars.)

- Went a-bicycling with half a view to snatching a glimpse of northern lights (no chance, too cloudy and southerly) and made a detour to see if a shed on a farm selling eggs was open (of course it wasn't) and ran over something. The thing scampered into a field, then stopped. I think it was a rabbit and the field was a church car park. Perhaps the rabbit was OK, I'd only grazed its tail, the what looked like a trail of blood on the road was something else, or perhaps not. If I'd had a plastic bag and a can-do attitude this could have been my chance to learn butchering skills and make a curry, but I did not and I'm sorry.
