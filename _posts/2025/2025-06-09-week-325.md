  (I've been finding large language models useful, sometimes, but you don't want to know â€“ it's boring and cringey, and one should keep these things to oneself. The worst thing about them, apart from all the draining of the aquifers, is the sullying of the âœ¨ emoji, and I'm not convinced that the sometimes-usefulness is enough to make up for those downsides.)

- ðŸŽ¦ The Ballad of Wallis Island (2025). Charming, notwithstanding its glamorisation of sky lanterns which can cause fires and pose a choking hazard for animals.

- To Kemah Bob's show at the arts centre.

- To Danny Baker's show at the Ipswich corn exchange. I'd forgotten about [my tepid review of last time](/2022/01/week-147). The old man talked and talked for three hours, which passed quickly and represented good value.

  There was a boxing match in town, so handily there were extra trains running. The train was [three trains coupled together](https://www.realtimetrains.co.uk/service/gb-nr:F28618/2025-06-07), and the rear three-tenths of the train was so suspiciously empty that, due to behavioural science, I too squeezed into one of the seven crowded carriages like sheep.
