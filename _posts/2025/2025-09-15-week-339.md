- The [letterbox motion sensor idea](/2025/09/week-337) may be a busted flush â€“ the sensor is intended for sensing motion in big rooms, not little letterboxes, and I think the letterbox is too far away and the signal won't go through so much wall and metal. What a waste of having things shipped back and forth overseas.

- Some things I am grateful for: I am free of seasonal lurgy, and I can make a passable shortcrust pastry. Twice I have tried to make a small apple crumble but accidentally made a pie.

- To the [Three Bean Salad](/2025/06/week-327) live show in London. Days later, I finished catching up with listening to all the free episodes of their podcast, a process which sent me a bit loopy at times and affected my dreams.

- In London, of course, the tube was on strike âœŠ I was happy to walk, would have anyway, although it was rainy and I was wearing <!--woke--> biodegradable shoes that are dangerously slippery in the wet. And umbrellas are an eye-poking menace, but maybe my real problem is Iâ€™m jealous of everyone who manages to use one without it blowing inside out â€“ it seems that you must be involved in golf or investment banking to get a really good umbrella.

- ðŸŽ¦ <i>The Roses</i> (2025). A waste of this month's free* cinema ticket but never mind.
