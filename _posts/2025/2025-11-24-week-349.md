- Tuesday: I woke late, after an unusually high quality and quantity of sleep, to some troubling alerts, and what a relief it was that it was [the Cloudflare outage](https://blog.cloudflare.com/18-november-2025-outage/) and not my fault.
  Pleased to say [the bustimes.org status page](https://status.bustimes.org), excellently hosted by the great [PikaPods](https://www.pikapods.com), was not affected. And some bits of bustimes.org, like the API, which I'd exempted from Cloudflare's bot management things, were still OK.

  After an hour or so, I had the bright idea of turning off the Cloudflare proxying – I'm grateful to [DNSControl](https://github.com/StackExchange/dnscontrol) and Certbot for helping me do that, and now I'm better prepared for next time. And I left it like that until the next day, when something happened that showed that Cloudflare's rate-limiting and caching are not yet dispensable.

- There's much to feel gloomy about, but did you know that many supermarkets these days have [a thing](/images/2025-11-kewpie-morrisons.PNG) that can tell you if a particular shop stocks a product and even what aisle it's in? No more wandering the aisles interminably looking for [tahini](/images/2025-11-tahini-tesco.PNG) or a member of staff to ask where the tahini is. What a time to be alive.


- In the Wikipedia article about the broadcaster (and possibly next BBC director general) June Sarpong, it says:

  > In late 2013, Elton John performed a variation of his 1970 hit <i>Your Song</i> with the amended lyrics “You can tell everybody “You’re June Sarpong”” as an apparent reference to an in-joke between the pair from a charity event earlier that year.

  Because they're [nested quotation marks](https://www.theguardian.com/media/mind-your-language/2016/mar/04/quotations-within-quotations-the-russian-doll-of-punctuation), the phrase "You're June Sarpong" should surely be in single not double quotes. Actually, depending who Elton John was addressing and what he meant, it shouldn't be in quotation marks at all. But the bigger problem is that it smells like a weird hoax. The only other source I could find is [the podcast of a venture capital firm](https://podcasts.apple.com/gb/podcast/live-talk-former-bbc-global-director-of-diversity/id1725729277?i=1000666219287):

  > It would be fair to say that June is considered a ‘British Icon’ and has broad cultural influence. Not everyone can claim that Elton John has performed a special edition of the hit "Your Song" with the amended lyrics "You can tell everybody, You're June Sarpong'"!

  There's some more dubious punctuation there, and also literally everyone can claim that – it just might not be true.
