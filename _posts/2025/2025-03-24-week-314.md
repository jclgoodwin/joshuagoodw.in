- My e-reader wasn’t connecting to the internet, so I put the “worry free guarantee (two-year limited warranty)” to the test, and the next morning a gleaming “new old stock” Kindle was at the door – sickeningly efficient. But the replacement wouldn’t connect either, and I realised that I – or rather the quirkiness of my Wi-Fi router – was in fact at fault. In the end it was a boring but ultimately soluble problem, which I’d made more complicated by dicking about with a [Pi-hole](https://pi-hole.net/) a while ago, so really it serves me right for such ad-blocking hypocrisy.

  I feel bad about the e-wastefulness of it all. I slightly wish the Amazon people had been a bit less customer-centric about it, treated me with suspicion, maybe asked me to try a different Wi-Fi network. And I bet the _new_ new Kindles have USB-C, and maybe they’ve moved the power button somewhere less stupid so the thing doesn’t switch off when you prop it up on a surface ([moaned about previously](/2023/11/week-243#:~:text=Amazon%20Kindle%20Kids”-,electronic%20reader,-is%20quite%20good)), but this has delayed the point at which it would be acceptable to upgrade.

- Resigned myself to having lost my MP3 collection. (I think that's a synecdoche for a collection that also contained MP4s and FLACs and probably even a WAV or two.) It's not a big deal – this wouldn't have happened if it mattered, I'd've had backups and a copy on my computer – but I feel like I've fallen short of the glory of God. While I was distracted by Spotify, bits rotted and hard drives got wiped and Google Play Music was sunsetted and I stopped subscribing to iTunes Match. (At least I did manage to recover a few albums from an old MP3 player.)

- To London's glittering Palladium [to watch another podcast](https://www.reddit.com/r/offmenupodcast/comments/1jgf5x8/julian_clary_is_tonights_guest_friday_21_march/ "Comedians Ed Gamble and James Acaster invite special guests into their magical restaurant to each choose their favourite starter, main course, side dish, dessert and drink") like a loser. Enjoyed it more than some of the critics on Reddit appeared to – guest Julian Clary treated the endeavour with the contempt it deserved, and it finished (quickly) in time for me to easily make the second from last train.

- To the medium-sized local venue to see [Richard Herring's show](https://richardherring.substack.com/p/bad-treatment#:~:text=already%20been%20with-,Can%20I%20Have%20My%20Ball%20Back%3F,-last%20July%2C%20but), and several days later to see Ania Magliano's. Bicycling home, I felt invigorated and stuff, but I don't know if that's the effect of emotionally hefty stand-up, or cycling.

- 🎦 <i>Opus</i> (2025). It’s not about the permissively licensed audio codec. One of John Malkovich’s character’s sobriquets is “the wizard of wiggle”, which is hardly “the nabob of sob” is it. A highlight was perhaps the nicest-looking bread I've ever seen on screen.

- <i>Anora</i> (2024) was certainly the best film I saw all week.

- 📺 I had no complaints about the last episode of <i>Severance</i>.
