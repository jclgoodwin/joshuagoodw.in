title: "Week 310: the carbon dioxide sensor beep"

- I heard a beep. A while later, another, then one every five minutes, and it drove me restless.
  Beeps aren’t distinctive, especially when a lot of devices probably all use the same off-the-shelf piezoelectric beepers – this beep reminded me of the robot vacuum cleaner, but unplugging that didn’t stop the beeping. I accused all sorts of things – the smoke alarm, my houseguests’ Bluetooth headphones, etc.

  Eventually, after a _lot_ of beeps, I realised that it was the carbon dioxide sensor – I can't find the blog post that convinced me to buy one back in 2022. Incredibly, I’m such a sad little hermit that I’ve never before had enough people exhaling in my home to raise the CO₂ level above 1400ppm.
  (By the by, I wonder if any/how many orgies have been ruined by carbon dioxide sensors.)

  In my defence, the app refers to a “buzzer”, which is misleading – a buzz is different to a beep.
  And hermitude isn't the full story – in warmer weather I keep the place better-ventilated.
  And perhaps I didn't always have the "beep every 5 minutes" setting switched on.

- Some things I've done on the computer recently:

  - Applied [this desktop wallpaper](https://www.reddit.com/r/theavalanches/comments/5qmecy/since_i_left_you_artwork_wallpaper/), with the Reduce Transparency setting to stop the menu bar being all yellow.

  - Started using [Ghostty](https://ghostty.org/) for my terminal needs. The only snag has been finding myself instinctively <kbd>⌘</kbd> + <kbd>F</kbd>-ing, which [doesn't work](https://github.com/ghostty-org/ghostty/issues/189).

  - Tidied my RSS feed subscriptions, which is how I learnt why one of the blogs I subscribed to had posted nothing new recently (prison for strangling his wife).
