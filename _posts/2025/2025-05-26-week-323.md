- I feel like I’m mentally declining – more than usual, I’ve forgotten to put the lid on the kettle, left cups of tea to go cold (I like cold black coffee, but not tea), left things out of the fridge, put ambient goods in the fridge (shortbread, antifungal cream), and most expensively got fined for forgetting to lock a rental bicycle at the end of a journey.

- Had some work frustrations, but let’s not forget to be grateful – the frustrations were a welcome distraction from the usual frustrations. And I was cheered up by going to send an email to the future and noticing this lovely bit of user interface in Apple Mail:

  <img src="/images/2025-05-26-mail-schedule-clock.gif" alt="The Send Later interface in Apple Mail. The mouse cursor is moving, dragging the minute of a clock hand around its face" width="376" height="318">

  Yes you can drag the hour hand too. And yes I use this feature quite a lot – although maybe I shouldn't and should be more brazen about being a night owl with a wobbly work-life balance – but usually I use the boring [Fastmail](https://join.fastmail.com/39b3c14f) website, which is not so whimsical.

- Someone's been [making stuff up about Garth Crooks on Wikipedia](/2024/02/crooks-last-dinner-party "last time") again. This about the pre-eminent football journalist Fabrizio Romano (via [a gullible Crystal Palace–based TikTok man](https://www.tiktok.com/@talkcpfc/video/7504781105413819670)):

  > Romano was discovered by Garth Crooks in 2010, while Crooks was MCing a corporate event at Fiat, where Romano was an employee. After being impressed by his knowledge of the Italian game, Crooks e-mailed BBC Director General Tim Davie, suggesting that Romano be given a guest segment on Crook's popular Team of the Week column.

  (It raises a lot of questions: wasn't Romano probably still in school in 2010? Isn't the Director General of the BBC too senior to to be dealing with such trifling matters as who is given a guest segment on a column? Mind you, Tim Davie wasn't appointed DG until 2020, so maybe he _was_ a lowly BBC Sport producer back then.)

  This, about the ex-footballer turned disgraced ex-presenter and pundit Jermaine Jenas, is a bit subtler:

  > Crooks also reportedly alerted BBC management to Jermaine Jenas’s potential as a pundit, having been impressed by his ability to correctly recall over a decade’s worth of Match of the Day 2 "Goal of the Month" winners during a dinner at an Indian restaurant.

  There's a case for letting it be, to see which broadsheet newspapers it ensnared, but I care too much about the truth. The problem is it breeds paranoia – now I read verifiably true things about Garth Crooks, like that [he presented Top of the Pops once in 1982](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubu4pAoHtYI), and he presented the short-lived late-night BBC Two political discussion programme [Despatch Box](http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk_politics/564771.stm), and I still doubt them.

- I've discovered a circumstance that can make the bus timetables on Citymapper, Google Maps etc. off by between a few and several minutes. (For example [here Citymapper's times](https://citymapper.com/london/bus/stops/340003338SEB) are eight minutes later than [the correct times](https://www.oxfordbus.co.uk/stops/340003338SEB), hint hint it's always an even number.) This is a test of my integrity, because if [my website is correct](https://bustimes.org/stops/340003338SEB) and some others aren't then that's not my problem, in fact it's sort of quite good for me. But if I really care about the truth, doing the right thing, and indeed public transport, I should try to let the relevant people know (if I can convince them that I'm not a blithering idiot).
