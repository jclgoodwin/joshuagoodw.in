- DigitalOcean gave me a $50 Amazon.com gift card for completing a survey, which is ironic because one of the few reasons to use DigitalOcean is maybe not wanting to use Amazon. (DO isn't Better than AWS, but being smaller has to count for something and limits its capacity for evil.) And it's a bit "free as in piano", because you can't spend an .com gift card on Amazon.co.uk, or donate it, or use it to buy something from the wishlist of a content creator you admire â€“ you've got to find something on the .com that ships to your address, costs exactly $50 including shipping, and is worth the carbon emissions of being shipped overseas. I bought some stationery, and welcome suggestions about how to spend the remaining $2.77.

- Had a bit of lurgy, after a blessedly lurgy-free winter, I think it's tree pollenâ€“related.

- ðŸŽ¦ Last week I saw <i>Sinners</i> (2025) and forgot to mention it, so I'm mentioning it now. (You will recall the story about Robert Johnson selling his soul to the devil at a local road junction, and to this day meeting at a public place like that is recommended by the likes of Gumtree and Facebook Marketplace.)

- To [Panic Shack](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V2PC1wlswjg) at the local arts centre.

- My birthday. The craggy face of surveillance capitalism, the Lidl Plus app, what business has it knowing my birthday, sent me a push notification about a free doughnut.
