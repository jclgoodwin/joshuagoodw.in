- Years ago, the consistency of Frank Cooper's Oxford marmalade changed and glucose-fructose syrup appeared in the list of ingredients. I was going to share the uplifting news that they've gone back to using normal sugar now, but [the website](https://www.frankcoopers.co.uk/our-products/original-oxford-marmalade/) lists glucose-fructose syrup and I don't think it's out of date, I think it means they've regressed to using the cheaper cornstarch-derived gloop again. The sainted Wayback Machine confirms that sugar was listed as recently as [April 2025](http://web.archive.org/web/20250420041529/https://www.frankcoopers.co.uk/our-products/original-oxford-marmalade/) and as long ago as [December 2023](http://web.archive.org/web/20231210080625/https://www.frankcoopers.co.uk/our-products/original-oxford-marmalade/), so I must savour the last good jar in my cupboard.

  (I know that the original marmalade [was originally made by Frank's wife Sarah-Jane](https://www.reddit.com/r/menwritingwomen/comments/pbxifw/so_frank_coopers_marmalade_isnt_actually_frank/), but it was named after Frank's shop where it was sold.)

- Spent half of the week in Liverpool. The train home was delayed by 90 minutes, and I was pleased to have hit the [Delay Repay](https://www.theguardian.com/money/2024/oct/24/thanks-to-this-unsung-magic-compensation-scheme-i-now-relish-a-delayed-train) jackpot. But they've only awarded me £6, because the system/a person is confused by [split ticketing](https://trainsplit.com/) and has also inexplicably mistaken one of my single tickets for a return; I can appeal, but maybe it's better for UK plc if I don't bother.

- When I was a small child, we were shown around a local church by the churchwarden who showed us his [staff/stave/wand](https://allsaintswhitby.org/historical-notes-queries-a-word-about-wands/), a sort of ornate stick. Apparently, as well as having a ceremonial use, it could be used to break up fights or to prod sleeping churchgoers. Later, in a classroom I noticed a long wooden pole with a hook on the end, and I deduced that the teacher must be a part-time churchwarden, but no it was just a tool for opening high windows. What a funny story.

- Last week I went to Screwfix for the first time. (Quick explainer: Screwfix is like a more intimidating version of Argos, where you can buy various hardware from a catalogue.) Recall [the lamp I broke last year](/2024/10/week-292), which I fixed with glue but it soon came apart again, but the broken part turns out to be a standard part that you can just _buy_. After buying the part, I realised it was the wrong size: I'd mixed up GU10 and MR16, I might have yelled "we're better than this" at myself. (Screwfix don't actually sell the right-sized part.)
