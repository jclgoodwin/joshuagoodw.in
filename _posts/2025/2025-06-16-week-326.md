- I've [tried some of the different supermarket gooseberry fools](/2025/04/week-316) now. Of course they have the same ingredients, the same sort of packaging, and they've all decided that exactly 114g is the correct amount of gooseberry fool. Unlike the others', Morrisons's gooseberry fool was positioned in its premium [The Best](https://morrisons.fandom.com/wiki/The_Best) range ... but now, and I think this might be a leading economic indicator, it's been discontinued and replaced with a cheaper-looking version, and dextrose has been appended to the list of ingredients.

- Weekended in London. It was nice and all that. Then I found myself in possession of [a rented Brompton](https://bromptonhire.com/) and some hours to kill, so did some pointless bicycling around and used the [Silvertown Cycle Shuttle](http://www.londonbusroutes.net/times/SCS.htm). The SCS was fine, underwhelming but what did I expect? On the two journeys I made, there was on average one other passenger. The system for securing non-folding bikes looked complicated, too much like shibari, so I got to practice folding and unfolding. It's a shame that the timetable doesn't appear in TfL's open data, so it's a pain to log on [Busmiles](https://busmiles.uk/buslog/j/details/854654317) â€“ but they don't want passengers to mistake it for a normal bus service, and that's more important than the concerns of a silly website for weirdos.

- While I was away I missed a dramatic thunderstorm, and also a fire in a neighbouring building. The cause of the fire was slightly interesting: some neighbours were perhaps defrosting their freezer, and put the freezer drawers outside on their balcony, and the sun shone through the transparent plastic and set fire to some cardboard, like a sociopathic child burning ants with a magnifying glass.

  With remarkable efficiency, the management company has updated the list of things not allowed on balconies, and its mixture of specificity and broadness is a bit like the tenth commandment, something like: open containers of petrol, soft furnishings, or any items at all. I'm a touch indignant, but if I have to get rid of the landlord's horrible naff fake plastic topiary, lest it bursts into flames, then that's good.
