<p>The morning. Out from beneath the many, restrictively heavy quilts &#8211; <em>this weather</em>, ehâ€½ &#8211; and off to a hospital, to be imaged medically. (It&#8217;s fine &#8211; I am, happily, very much <em>not</em> on on the brink of death, or anything like that.) I am given a set of headphones, ostensibly for masking the noisy clangs and clunks of the medical imaging machinery, and relaying messages from medical professionals, but really so I can pretend to be a contestant on the Saturday evening quiz programme Eamonn Holmes used to present. Or a Cyberman.</p>
<p>I am heartened by this measure, but disappointed that Radio 2 is the piped-through sound of choice. <em>Sort it out, Jeremy Hunt</em>, I think. (I think &#8220;Andrew Lansley&#8221; at first, and he seems like a more deserving scapegoat, but apparently he&#8217;s no longer the Secretary of State for Health. Who knew?)</p>
<p>Of course, it&#8217;s not all bad, because the abominable Ken Bruce does prompt me to reflect on my frankly shocking lack of knowledge of the works of Suzi Quatro, and for that I am grateful. While I do not then proceed to do anything about it, I  promise that I will. Well, probably not.</p>
