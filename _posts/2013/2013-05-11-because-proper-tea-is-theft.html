title: Because proper tea is theft

<blockquote><p><a href="https://twitter.com/impropaganda/status/299085288997785601">SAVE money on expensive peppermint teabags by simply brushing your teeth before your morning cuppa.</a></p></blockquote>
<p>That&#8217;s a funny message posted on the internet site Twitter, but we must be serious for a moment: it&#8217;s not based on truth; peppermint teabags aren&#8217;t expensive.</p>
<p>Recently, I ran out of milk. And we know that&#8217;s an unsolvable problem &#8211; I&#8217;m not, like, a cow or something. So I had simply no choice &#8211; no choice at all &#8211; but to forgo my usual cheap and nasty breakfast blend, and in its place to mainline peppermint tea, which <em>doesn&#8217;t</em> need to be taken &#8211; nay, which strictly <em>must not</em> be taken &#8211; with a splash of anything to mask the unpleasantness. Sure, I like peppermint tea &#8211; that&#8217;s why I have it around &#8211; it&#8217;s especially excellent for settling one&#8217;s innards after some suspicious prawns or dubiously warm yoghurt &#8211; but maybe it&#8217;s not nice all the time, so you should feel my woe.</p>
<p>Well, now the supply of peppermint teabags is dwindling, and soon I&#8217;ll be left with just the bunch whose attached pieces of string with paper labels (pictured) are all mutually and irreversibly entwined (not pictured).</p>
<div id="attachment_8146" style="width: 610px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img class="size-large wp-image-8146" src="/wp/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/DSC00013-001-1024x410.jpg" alt="Strings attached" width="600" height="240" /><p class="wp-caption-text">Strings attached</p></div>
<p>Now, in the land of <em>proper</em> teabags &#8211; which it <em>is</em> customary to rescue from the drink after a while &#8211; I would greatly appreciate such a miniature rope to excuse me from scalding my fingers, and from the attached anxiety about melted fingerprints leading to my being accused of murder. But only a ruddy savage would ever need to lift out a peppermint teabag, because in their case the stewing process only in fact enhances the ravishing flavour.</p>
<p>Which makes it all the more frustrating that the quite rare (in my experience) little string-and-paper tails are these days only ever found at the ends of particular teabag varieties where they can only ever be damn nuisances. It&#8217;s the worst thing about modern Britain.</p>
