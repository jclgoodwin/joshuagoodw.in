title: Semi-fortnightly

<p>The &#8220;biweekly&#8221; word is difficult. Does it mean &#8220;twice per week&#8221; or &#8220;every two weeks&#8221;? It&#8217;s an old chestnut, and generations have looked for an answer. I mustn&#8217;t call it the <em>definition</em> of ambiguity, because that&#8217;s not what it is, but it is a good example of it.</p>
<p>I gave some thought to the thing. Since we&#8217;ve already got a perfectly good word for &#8220;every two weeks&#8221; (&#8220;fortnightly”), I decided that &#8220;biweekly&#8221; must be used for all other situations, and to make that my recommendation. I felt jolly pleased with myself, and rightly so, right?</p>
<p>Well, no. Here&#8217;s Marco Arment in <a href="http://www.marco.org/2011/07/21/the-critical-path-3-apple-cash#fn:1">a footnote</a> to a blog post about a podcast about sodding <em>market analysis</em> (my sentiment, not his, although I&#8217;ll admit that I listen to it too. Anyhow, it&#8217;s a fortnightly podcast):</p>
<blockquote>
<p>By convention, “biweekly” should mean “every two weeks”. Unfortunately, the <em>bi-</em> suffix has been misunderstood so frequently to mean “twice per” instead of “every two” that “biweekly” now <a href="http://term.ly/biweekly">uselessly means</a> “every two weeks” <em>or</em> “twice per week”.</p>
<p>The <em>semi-</em> prefix properly, and only, means “twice per”. Therefore, the correct word for “twice per week” is “semiweekly”. But since misunderstandings of this have ruined <em>bi-</em>, there’s now no English word that unambiguously means “every two weeks”. (Except “fortnightly”, which is ridiculous.)</p>
<p>I’m using “biweekly” to properly mean “every two weeks” in protest of this widespread definition-shifting vocabularly ignorance.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>OK, then.</p>
