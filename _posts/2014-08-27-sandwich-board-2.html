<p>(Or: &#8220;Fuss Islands Retail Park&#8221;.)</p>
<p>Months have passed since the <em>beleaguered supermarket chain</em> Morrisons did a capital wheeze, <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2014/may/11/public-art-adverts-subconscious-for-sale-stewart-lee">projecting a picture of a baguette between the wingtips of the Angel of the North</a>. Interestingly, it wasn&#8217;t the first time it&#8217;d had ideas about a tall structure in the north of England.</p>
<p>In 2007, work was underway to turn the site of an old <a href="http://yorkstories.co.uk/the-destructor-notes-from-the-archives/">refuse &#8220;<strong>destructor</strong>”</a> into a retail park. One prominent relic of the site&#8217;s previous use was to remain: a grade II listed octagonal chimney&#8230;</p>
<p>Naturally, such a development necessarily entails lots of planning applications &#8211; and, wonderfully, the poorly scanned evidence of this <a href="https://www.google.co.uk/search?q=site%3Aplanningaccess.york.gov.uk+foss+islands+retail+park">is available online</a>. So we can read the planning application entitled &#8220;<a href="http://planningaccess.york.gov.uk/online-applications/applicationDetails.do?activeTab=summary&amp;keyVal=JCUCBSSJ95000">Display of externally illuminated individual letters to south face of chimney”</a>. It&#8217;s not a classic of the form, there&#8217;s no gloriously stiffly written literature to read (there often is), but there is a drawing.</p>
<p><a class="image" href="/wp/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/morrisons.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-8711" src="/wp/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/morrisons-640x449.jpg" alt="morrisons" width="600" height="420" /></a></p>
<p>The status of the application is &#8220;application refused&#8221; and <a href="http://planningaccess.york.gov.uk/online-applications/files/79C218331F3EBB7EE85F8BAD6A53D1E0/pdf/07_00230_LBC-DELEGATED_REPORT-295227.pdf">the sternly critical &#8220;delegated report&#8221; is available to read</a> &#8211; a small sop to fans of that prose style.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m heartened that brave development control officers are there, ready to stop big corporates pissing on pieces of industrial heritage. A small part of me wonders what it would have looked like, but <a href="http://www.yorkpress.co.uk/news/1233815._This_is_without_doubt_absolutely_the_silliest_idea_I___ve_ever_heard_of_/">the local newpspaper has a mock-up</a>.</p>
<p>Having a big chimney next to one&#8217;s supermarket still comes with some advantages, a certain gravitas, whether or not one is permitted to strap a logo to it. <a href="http://yorkstories.co.uk/the-destructor-notes-from-the-archives/">&#8220;It’s now known to many as ‘Morrisons Chimney’, perhaps giving the erroneous impression that the supermarket recently built alongside incorporates a very large fireplace.”</a> They <em>could</em> have projected a baguette onto it.</p>
<hr />
<p>Also, a man flew an unmanned aerial vehicle around the chimney, and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E_V4Mh1LNrc">there&#8217;s a video</a>. The pictures are frankly a bit disappointingly lousy &#8211; shaky and pasty-faced &#8211; but for heaven&#8217;s sake he flew a consumer-grade remote-controlled miniature aircraft, with a tiny video camera on it, in the sky. Isn&#8217;t that impressive?</p>
