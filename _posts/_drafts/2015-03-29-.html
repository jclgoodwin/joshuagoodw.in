<p>I quite like Patum Peperium Gentleman&#8217;s Relish, and I don&#8217;t mind who knows it. In fact, it&#8217;s probably my favourite of all the spiced anchovy relishes.</p>

<p>When I began writing this, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gentleman's_Relish">its Wikipedia entry</a> still had a strong &#8220;In popular culture&#8221; section. Since then, some po-faced monster has removed it, although of course <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Gentleman%27s_Relish&amp;diff=640250314&amp;oldid=638653632">you can still read the old version</a>. If I were a true Gentleman&#8217;s Relish fan, I would start some kind of &#8220;edit war&#8221;, but I haven&#8217;t which I suppose proves I&#8217;m not one.</p>
<p>Whereas some other anchovy pastes come in tubes &#8211; easily confusable for tomato purée or toothpaste &#8211; Gentleman&#8217;s Relish comes in a pot. On the label is written &#8220;Use very sparingly&#8221;. <a href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/home/moslive/article-1374395/Patum-Peperium-Gentlemans-Relish-My-favourite-fishy-snack.html">Tom Parker Bowles writes in the <cite>Daily Mail</cite> that</a> &#8220;In an age where excess consumption is not just endured but encouraged, this comes as a breath of fresh air.&#8221; Parker Bowles may approve, but it always makes me worry <em>am I using sparingly enough?</em> So it&#8217;s a comfort that the picture accompanying the article shows some relish being used not very sparingly at all, far less sparingly than I would ever allow.</p>
<p>For those of us who aren&#8217;t the son of the heir presumptive to the Earldom of Macclesfield &#8211; or maybe especially for those of us who are, because aren&#8217;t aristocrats increasingly penurious people living in crumbly houses? &#8211; an important question is <em>what the most relish I can buy for the least money?</em> The following table shows the prices and weights of the pots available from what I think are the three largest Gentleman&#8217;s Relish&#8211;stocking retail chains, correct at the time of publication according to <a href="http://www.mysupermarket.co.uk/">mySupermarket.co.uk</a>:</p>
