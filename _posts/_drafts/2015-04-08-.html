<p>The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Kingdom_general_election,_2015">general election</a> campaign is happening. The political parties involved all have policies and things, but let&#8217;s pretend for a moment that their so-called &#8220;battle buses&#8221; are important. Let&#8217;s investigate them.</p>
<h3>Liberal Democrats</h3>
<p>The first thing to make clear is this: none of the top three parties are using an actual bus; the phrase &#8220;battle bus&#8221; is only in use because of alliteration.</p>

<p>The Lib Dems&#8217; bus is really a coach. OK, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coach_(bus)">Wikipedia says</a> a coach &#8220;is a type of bus&#8221;, and is &#8220;often simply called a bus&#8221;, but I maintain that &#8220;coach&#8221; is a much better word for vehicles like the <a href="http://www.vanhool.be/ENG/coaches/TX-range/TXaltanoEN.html#specsTX18Altano">Van Hool TX18 Altano</a>. And if alliteration is so important, how about the phrase &#8220;campaign coach&#8221;?</p>

<p>The Lib Dems&#8217; coach belongs to <a href="http://www.westwaycoaches.co.uk/">Westway Coach Services</a>, and <a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/benbeaver95/16757943707">photographs on Flickr</a> show that most of the time, when not sheathed in yellow vinyl, it&#8217;s a rather bland colour.</p>
<p>The Telegraph has a poor article entitled <a href="http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/general-election-2015/11502913/Nick-Cleggs-battle-bus-has-trouble-turning-left-at-campaign-launch.html">&#8220;Nick Clegg&#8217;s battle bus has trouble turning left at campaign launch&#8221;</a>. Many parts of the article are poor, such as the caption of this photograph:</p>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-8929" src="/wp/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/Screenshot-from-2015-04-07-233719.png" alt="Picture in the Telegraph showing Nick Clegg waving through the door of a coach" width="475" height="336" /></p>
<p>First of all, there ought to be an apostrophe after &#8220;Lib Dems&#8221;. Secondly, the whole premise of the caption is wrong &#8211; the picture shows not a bus struggling to get down a road, but Nick Clegg waving as he stands in the doorway of a coach.</p>
<p>Interestingly, the Lib Dems also hired <a href="http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/general-election-2015/11504188/On-the-buses-General-election-campaign-battle-buses-in-pictures.html?frame=3250432">a Van Hool from Westway in the previous general election</a>.</p>
<h3>Conservatives</h3>

<p>The Conservatives&#8217; bus is also a coach. It&#8217;s an Irizar i6, apparently on a Scania chassis, on hire from <a href="https://www.flickr.com/search/?text=%22yt12%20rlv%22">The Kings Ferry</a>. Under the horrible vinyls is that National Express&#8211;owned operator&#8217;s livery, <a href="https://www.flickr.com/search/?text=%22YT12%20RLV%22">shown in various photographs on Flickr</a>.</p>

<p>Again, the Tories used another Irizar back in 2010:</p>
