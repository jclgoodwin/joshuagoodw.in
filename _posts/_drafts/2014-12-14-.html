<p>The internet site Twitter is abuzz with people &#8220;realising&#8221; the supposed fact that the numbers etched onto the dial on a toaster represent minutes (and not &#8220;the degree of toastiness&#8221; or some such).</p>
<p>I&#8217;m not sure what&#8217;s behind this trend, but it&#8217;s definitely a trend. <a href="http://topsy.com/analytics?q1=toaster%20minutes">There were 22 542 messages containing the words &#8220;toaster&#8221; and &#8220;minutes&#8221; posted on 2 December, compared to a typical 11 two days before.</a> This one seems to have been the first:</p>
