<p>I have a Braun AB5 (Type 4748) alarm clock. I think it&#8217;s one of the original ones, and not the modern revival (the BNC001), which is not to say I think one is better than the other or anything.</p>

<p>The Silicon Valley blowhard Dustin Curtis has a BNC002 &#8211; a modern revivial of a slightly different Braun alarm clock &#8211; which he reckons is &#8220;the best&#8221;. It&#8217;s not clear if he&#8217;s investigated ones produced before Dieter Rams entered his dotage and took up bonsai gardening, or necessarily. I think the more circular rounder shape,  ((The other essay in that series, in which he bleats cutlery, is a bit more contemptible.))</p>
<p>I unders has &#8220;German Movement&#8221; written on its face, which shows a suspiciously fierce keenness to insist that it&#8217;s definitely not inferior to the original model.<sup><a href="#footnote_0_8811" id="identifier_0_8811" class="footnote-link footnote-identifier-link" title="Clearly, the new licensees of the Braun name were trying carefully not to alienate the sorts of people who yelped when&nbsp;Moleskine notebooks began&nbsp;having &ldquo;Manufactured in China&rdquo; written on them (qv).">1</a></sup> My supposedly original AB5 isn&#8217;t brilliant &#8211; it makes a quite audible ticking noise, and features the same horrible rhapsody-of-beeps alarm sound as every other commodity alarm clock I&#8217;ve met.</p>
<p>Recently, my AB5 became a bit broken. What I will call <em>the alarm hand</em> no longer correctly indicated the actual time at which the alarm would sound; and the hour and minute hands had become misaligned such that when the minute hand was pointing at 12 (at what I think they call <em>the top of the hour</em>), the hour hand was not pointing directly at any number. Neither catastrophic problems, but both annoying, so I wondered how to fix them.</p>
