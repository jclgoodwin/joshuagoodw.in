- The face is bare again. The skin left behind now seems especially fresh and radiant.

- Bought [a sun hat](https://www.amazon.co.uk/Tilley-Endurables-LTM6-Airflo-Hat/dp/B0033WRVQI?tag=joshgood-21), to keep the skin fresh and radiant. It happens to be Canadian, and, at least when I cram it onto my head, has something cowboyish about it, which is quite a statement – but did you ever see a sunburnt Canadian cowboy? I didn't think so.

- The third part of the ongoing saga: there is [a new, more repairable and aspirational, new toaster](https://www.amazon.co.uk/Dualit-26205-2-Slot-Lite-Toaster/dp/B003MVYQWM). Took the previous toaster back to the shop. The original toaster sits waiting for the dump to reopen. (A minor thing about devolution is how some chummy councils speak of tips and dumps, whereas others pompositise about household recycling centres.)

- Wore the mask for the first time, at a supermarket. Felt sweaty and strange, and very much in the minority, but us trailblazers are needed to blaze trails or whatever.

- I found myself reinstalling macOS, which is like a <cite>Viz</cite> Top Tips way of experiencing the busywork associated with getting a new computer. It didn't have the desired effect of making the computer more reliable. I have long suspected [the third party SSD](https://9to5mac.com/2016/04/25/review-owc-aura-pcie-flash-storage-upgrade-capacity-mid-2013-later-macbook/) to be to blame for it getting hot and bothered and `IONVMeController` related crashes. (Writing this, I've learnt there are newer, possibly better versions of that I could try... but it's slightly too late as I may have just sent for a whole new computer. Oh well, 4–5 years is still a parsimonious replacement cycle for a machine used for Important Business.)

- I spent some time identifying a bus seen in <cite>Killing Eve</cite>. We only see the interior, which matches [an Alexander Dennis Enviro400H operated by Tower Transit](https://www.flickr.com/photos/97628863@N06/34993673162/). Spent some further time taking a screenshot to upload to [the Internet Movie Cars Database](https://www.imcdb.org/m7016936.html) but the swines silently deleted it, as they had [my last contribution](/2020/01/weeks-41-42).
