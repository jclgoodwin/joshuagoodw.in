<blockquote>
<p>Sometimes I think about all the waste produced by putting toys in cereal boxes. First, adults buy and consume many of those boxes, and don&#8217;t want the toys. Second, most children don&#8217;t want the toys, either. Or, even if they do, a bit, let&#8217;s be honest: children (to their credit) probably prefer the delicious cereal, just like adults. A child looks at the toy, thinks about having got something for free, puts it aside, and picks up his spoon. That&#8217;s it. The proof-of-purchase system (mail in box-tops, get a prize) may not have offered the instant-gratification kapow that today&#8217;s buzzing, sugar-pissed youth demands, but it was environmentally responsible.</p>

<p>In fact, I think the proof-of-purchase system is still firmly in place &#8211; the gratification has become <em>less instant</em> in my lifetime. Kennedy has got his chronology inverted.</p>
<p>(Actually, I don&#8217;t know, I eat m√ºesli now. To be precise: Aspen, Asprin, Michael Aspel, I don&#8217;t know. My point is that it&#8217;s a different world, one where everyone accepts that just <em>some sultanas</em> can provide anyone&#8217;s recommended daily allowance of delight.)</p>
