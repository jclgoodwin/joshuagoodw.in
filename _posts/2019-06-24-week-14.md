What happened this week?

On Monday, writing about the previous week, I missed a gaping oppunity to fabiricate an ["and then the whole bus clapped"](https://knowyourmeme.com/memes/and-then-the-whole-bus-clapped) ending to a story. I apologise.

I did some work. In what's fast becoming a tale as old as time, something broke on Tuesday morning but I didn't notice until in the evening (after a day of which some sweaty hours were spent bicycling frivolously) I spotted someone moaning (in the nicest possible way) on an internet forum. There are some opportunities there for me to improve the "monitoring" situation, maybe use the internet of things to administer an electric shock – actually, the excellent [Sentry](https://sentry.io/) had sent me an automatic email about the error, but it got lost among all the other ones I can safely ignore.

On Sunday, I renewed my [Browserstack](https://www.browserstack.com/) subscription and got all interested in whether things work OK with old web browsers that hardly anyone uses any more.
The answer is they mostly do – and even a little bit better now.
I have a habit of writing old-fashined JavaScript without using any modern conveniences, which is a bit like writing a lipogram or in C, and which a part of me thinks I ought to grow out of.
_This_ website looks surprisingly good even in the Microsoft Internet Explorer 6 of my youth, which is not that surprising as there's not that much to go wrong.
