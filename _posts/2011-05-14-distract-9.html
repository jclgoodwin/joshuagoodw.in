<p>In my experience, writing distractions tend to be more tangible and very little to do with whatever word processor Iâ€™m using. You know, stuff like having a full-time job, messing about on Twitter and more recently, organising a wedding.</p>

<p>Oh, I would write more, but I just spend great whole <em>hours</em> staring at the animated paperclip. What a problem. (Maybe we&#8217;re treating distraction and procrastination too much like they&#8217;re supposed to mean the same thing here, but that shouldn&#8217;t erode anyone&#8217;s point.)</p>
<p>One important thing, that these applications probably try to address but do a poor job of advertising, is just decent text design, by which I mean uncramped <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leading">leading</a>, muted contrast, and an agreeable line length, you know? It&#8217;s not really about distraction at all, it&#8217;s about how pleasant something is to read back through. <a href="http://wordpress.org/news/2011/05/wordpress-3-2-beta-1/">WordPress 3.2</a> seems to be doing it pretty well.</p>
<p>Another intriguing theme came up repeatedly in <a href="http://daringfireball.net/linked/2011/04/13/15-slides">this excellent (audio recording of an) SXSW presentation</a>: the idea that changing one&#8217;s perspective &#8211; by printing something out, or reclining on the patio, or changing the background colour &#8211; can be helpful. Maybe you&#8217;ll groan at how damn obvious that is to you, but I for one was rather impressed, and it&#8217;s clear that software would do well to enable this. Again, WordPress 3.2 is very promising in this regard, with the great improvements that have been made to its full-screen mode, accompanying the also-slightly-tweaked &#8220;distracting&#8221; non&#8211;full-screen mode, and the untouched in situ preview function. Well done, Admiral WordPress.</p>
