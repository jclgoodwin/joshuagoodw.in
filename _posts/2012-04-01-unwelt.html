<p>Today, <a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/comics/comments/rnpiw/mindboggling_xkcd_april_fools_comic/">curated for your own home armchair adventuring by the tireless jackals crawling with the internet site &#8220;reddit&#8221;</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>If you go visit <a href="http://xkcd.com/1037/" title="The author is not familiar">xkcd</a> it may appear to be just a normal, though perhaps surprisingly relevant comic. But in fact, there&#8217;s a massive set of comics that appears based on your location, browser, and other unknown variables.</p></blockquote>
<p>Profound, for a Sunday. (Nice of them to put April-Foolery Day on a weekend for once, wasn&#8217;t it? One of the ones on which I did wake before noon, but yes. Not sure if there&#8217;s someone who decides, or it&#8217;s determined on the thread of happenstance by the distance between the moon and Jesus &#8211; but even if it is the moon, there&#8217;s someone on the end who decides where <em>it</em> shall be, right?)</p>
<p>Here&#8217;s the thing: I don&#8217;t frequent these websites, so I don&#8217;t know anything. For one thing, I don&#8217;t know if linking to this is like that album, &#8220;The Best of the Beatles&#8221;, is it? Old news by now. Say, did you know the one about the smell of burning coffee when you&#8217;re selling your house? It&#8217;s just, there&#8217;s so much novelty here for me, and yet fake small caps is the meat and potatoes of you people. Strange. This is what it must be like to be Greek.</p>
<p>God spede.</p>
