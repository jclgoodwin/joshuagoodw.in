- Some things I forgot to mention last week:

  - The anniversary of the last time I shook a hand. Although I can't remember the last time I shook a hand without thinking "was that a good idea?" afterwards.

  - Some other things I've forgotten again.

- The delight of a reaxled bicycle. I enjoyed a muddy ride and saw [a notable bench](https://twitter.com/openbenches/status/1372228655938691082).

- Some work.
  
  You know how the government is addicted to the services of management consultants? Consultants who are only trying to do their jobs, etc, but hmm. Well, the problem I encountered in week 103 got fixed, so well done to them. Then on Sunday, instead of writing this, I found a new one, and sent off a report that evening, which I think is what is called a "weird flex" or is that when you use something novel to plug in an iron, ha ha.
 
- You know you can change the voice of the "Siri" character on your Apple cellphone. Historically, I've found the man voices less problematic, but this week I've settled on the Irish lady voice and found it/her most agreeable.
