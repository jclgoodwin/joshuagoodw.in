- Anyone who uses the word “dinner” is an arse. Because there’s dinner as in “dinner lady”, also known as “lunch”, and there’s the tory dinner as in “dinner party”, known as “tea” or “supper” to sensible people. Yes, the meaning is usually clear from the context, and yes, dinner ladies are called MSAs (midday/mealtime support assistants) these days, but why be ambiguous? And yes, [it is a class warfare thing](http://www.sirc.org/publik/foxfood.pdf).

- There was much shouting about Fleets, the new pretend Instagram Stories content type on Twitter, and I was dismayed that I couldn't access this new feature because it was still being [rolled out](https://twitter.com/DaftLimmy/status/1329432485508354055). And then I _could_ access it, and it was underwhelming. ¯\\\_(ツ)\_/¯

- A type of beer that had disappeared from UK shelves has reappeared on UK shelves, in enormous boxfuls. I picked up an enormous box and carried it as far as the checkouts, then thought better of it – it was such a heavy enormous box, so hubristic, what was I thinking? – and returned it to the pile on the other side of the big shop, all covered in my germs. Oh dear, but I got away with it, and maybe one day it will be expedient to buy such a boxful, with the help of a trolley and a bicycle.

- It turns out that Morrison’s stocks <cite>Buses</cite> magazine. The barcode scans as <cite>Barbie</cite> magazine, which is 89p cheaper than the <cite>Buses</cite> cover price, _and_ it’s more respectable to appear interested in barbecues or dolls than buses, so great.

- The consumer pronoun <cite>Which?</cite> has pronounced on shop bought mince pies. Their website has a paywall, but various newspaper correspondents are here to [reword press releases](https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2020/nov/19/budget-mince-pies-from-asda-and-iceland-top-which-taste-test) and reveal the results for free. They gave short shrift to the "claggy" Sainsbury's pies [which remain my favourites so far](/2020/10/week-83) and deserve longer shrift. 

- The bicycle had gone months without sustaining a puncture, which reflects excellently on the Kevlar reinforcement of the Schwalbe City Jet tyres. Then this week there was a puncture – in fact, two punctures at the same time – which I fixed and it was fine. So that was something to do. Cool story.

- 📺 <cite>Industry</cite>. I have also watched some of <cite>Ted Lasso</cite>, which ... well, it's unusual that they made the trailer make it look much worse than it actually is.

This is a bit boring isn't it
