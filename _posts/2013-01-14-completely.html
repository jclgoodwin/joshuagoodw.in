<p>Julian Baggini, who is the author of several books about philosophy &#8211; not &#8220;on&#8221;, please, <em>&#8220;about</em>&#8221; philosophy &#8211; but is not an actual philosopher, so I&#8217;m not so enormously jealous, asks <a href="http://www.aeonmagazine.com/being-human/julian-baggini-coffee-artisans/">&#8220;Have we completely lost faith in the human touch?&#8221;</a>, which seems like a random question unless in the context of his immediately prior observation that, these days, &#8220;Even the finest restaurants are serving coffee made with capsules.&#8221;</p>
<p>(And hey, well, isn&#8217;t itÂ poignant that this kind of lazy, curatory blogging seems like just the most golden example of a job &#8211; I pretend that it is one of those, but only fleetingly &#8211; that could be more cheaply done by such robots as Baggini describes. Maybe. Shut up, please.)</p>
