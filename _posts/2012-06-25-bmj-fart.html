<p><a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1121900/">From the British Medical Journal&#8217;s sort of trivia section</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>“It all started with an enquiry from a nurse,” Dr Karl Kruszelnicki told listeners to his science phone-in show on the Triple J radio station in Brisbane. “She wanted to know whether she was contaminating the operating theatre she worked in by quietly farting in the sterile environment during operations, and I realised that I didn&#8217;t know. But I was determined to find out.”</p></blockquote>
<p>This is what science journalism we need.</p>
