<p><a href="http://dawnhfoster.wordpress.com/2012/06/05/friends-wealth-and-enemies/">Dawn Foster on the rather welcome transatlantic force of Paul Krugman</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>It’s telling, that the Conservatives in the Newsnight clip view austerity as something slightly abstract, not something that has direct consequences on people’s lives. Something tells me that those in the social circles the government mix aren’t affected by austerity measures. Just a slight inkling, but perhaps they won’t know people who rely on subsistence benefits, or have had the DLA on which they rely cut, and are now destitute.</p></blockquote>
