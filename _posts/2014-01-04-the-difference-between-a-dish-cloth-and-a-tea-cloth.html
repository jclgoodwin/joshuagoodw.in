title: '&#8216;The difference between a dish-cloth and a tea-cloth&#8217;'
---

<p>From chapter 7 of <a href="http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/836"><cite>The Phoenix and the Carpet</cite></a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>Everything was nicely washed up, and dried, and put in its proper place, and the dish-cloth washed and hung on the edge of the copper to dry, and the tea-cloth was hung on the line that goes across the scullery. (If you are a duchess&#8217;s child, or a king&#8217;s, or a person of high social position&#8217;s child, you will perhaps not know the difference between a dish-cloth and a tea-cloth; but in that case your nurse has been better instructed than you, and she will tell you all about it.)</p></blockquote>
