title: The shelf and the head
---

<p>Sunday – as in, not yesterday but the Sunday before that – was a glorious humdinger of a day. I have <a href="/yesterday">already mentioned many of the wicked-cool occurrences here on this blog</a>. But I didn’t mention one significant event, so I’ll mention it now.</p>
<p>On Sunday, I found myself at the house inhabited by my grandmother. I decided to go to the toilet. I think you’ll agree with me that there’s nothing unusual about that – as a matter of fact, I’m astonished that Tom Jones never mentioned it in his song, It’s Not Unusual.</p>
<p>I walked to the bathroom and closed the door. There was a time when, because the door was a little too big, this would be a fatal action – after wedging the flap shut, it would take a flurry of kicking, screaming, blood, sweat, tears and chipped paint to get out again – but that time is long gone, as a builder has apparently since shaved some wood off. I was even able to make use of the recently-installed latch – sure, I wasn’t worried about someone walking in on me by accident, but one may as well make use of such a facility when it is available.</p>
<p>I did what I had come to the loo to do – I won’t go into great detail about this, because I’m aware that you might be nibbling a nice snack as you read this – and then it was time to wash my hands.</p>
<p>I turned to the sink. There it was, underneath the mirror, a light, and a shelf.</p>
<p>Then, I headbutted the shelf.</p>
<p>I’m not quite sure how I headbutted the shelf. I think I might have tripped over the bathroom scales, or something. I certainly didn’t trip over the bath mat, because there wasn’t a bathmat, and it takes quite some skill to trip over something that isn’t there. (Although of course, a prodigal genius like this one is, I’m sure, more likely than most people to be able to manage it.)</p>
<p>The point is, I headbutted the shelf. In a flash, it was transformed from a sturdy surface on which toiletries could securely and reliably balanced, to a wonky distressed damsel. Everything fell off &#8211; the toothbrushes, the toothpaste, the dental floss. Even the mouthwash was spilt.</p>
<p>It was terrible. Carnage. The shelf was hanging on one bracket like it had been in a fight with a spotty, shaven-headed youth called Vince.</p>
<p>Except no, the shelf had not encountered a spotty youth named Vince. It had simply encountered my head.</p>
<p>But this youth, though not named Vince, has also been mildly spotty recently. And as a result, this youth has been using <a href="http://www.clearasil.co.uk/">Clearasil</a>. This does as it is supposed to minimising the spottiness, but the trade-off is that my face is as smooth as a baby&#8217;s bottom.</p>
<p>&#8220;What?&#8221; you exclaim in puzzlement. &#8220;What&#8217;s wrong with that?&#8221;</p>
<p>Well, dear reader, the baby&#8217;s posterior to which I refer is that an infant suffering from the unfortunate condition known nappy rash. Which isn&#8217;t quite so smooth and soft and wonderful; so deep and crisp and even.</p>
<p>And how does this relate to my incident with the shelf? Let me explain.</p>
<p>Although, of course, the sudden impact when head and shelf met appears to have wiped my memory and rendered me incapable of recalling what really happened, my hypothesis is that I was just shocked to see in the mirror the reflection of my crusty, crispy face, made so crispy and crusty by Clearasil.</p>
<p>Really, I needn&#8217;t bother. The spottiness is minuscule &#8211; using any type of Clearasil is like cracking a sledgehammer with a walnut &#8211; and the dry skin makes it like then going on to hit your thumb by mistake.</p>
<p>Suffice to say, my deep cleansing lotion is staying in the cupboard for a while, as I would rather have a few &#8220;zits&#8221; and moist skin than some wilting blackheads and crusty, horrid skin. Perhaps it&#8217;ll remain there forever, although you never know when the elephant will escape from the local zoo and require someone &#8211; as in, me &#8211; to stand in for it.</p>
<p>Never let it be said that I am not prepared for anything.</p>
