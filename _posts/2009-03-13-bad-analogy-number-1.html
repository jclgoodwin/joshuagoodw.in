title: Bad analogy number 1

<p>Some say that a blog without series (serieses?) is like wire without barbs &#8211; it just isn&#8217;t complete. So here is the first of what I doubt, but still hope, will be a long-running and successful series. Well, some people do the National Lottery. In fact, I was in a shop this very afternoon, where I bought a new ballpoint pen with a special rubber grip, the woman in front of me was buying a lottery ticket&#8230; enough! Why is that analogy, that analogy up there in the blockquote, so very bad?</p>
<p>I say that an orange without its peel would be a marvellous thing. I&#8217;m often struggling to open oranges. This morning, in fact, I dug my recently-trimmed fingernails into a blood orange only to have the sticky acidic juices go all over the place. Is Joel Reyes suggesting that typography makes web design spray orange juice all over the place?</p>
<p>I was also devastated to find that that this blog was not listed in <a href="http://www.smashingmagazine.com/2009/03/12/fantastic-typography-blogs-for-your-inspiration/">that list</a>. Boo. Hiss. Then I realised that, well, that list is a list of blogs about typography. Fantastic ones. I need say no more &#8211; already it is acutely apparent why I was not mentioned.</p>
<p>Just in case a similar list turns up in future, I&#8217;d like to mention that <a href="http://new.myfonts.com/fonts/hamburger/tooting-sans/">Tooting Sans</a> is a funny name. Do you think that that will do it?</p>
