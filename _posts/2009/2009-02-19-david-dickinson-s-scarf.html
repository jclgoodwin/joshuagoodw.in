title: David Dickinsonâ€™s scarf
---

<p>Does anyone actually watch such television programmes as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flog_It!"><cite>Flog It!</cite></a>, and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bargain_Hunt"><cite>Bargain Hunt</cite></a>?</p>
<p>It would be nice if nobody did. But clearly people do, because the sensible folks of the <span class="caps">BBC</span> would not be silly enough to broadcast television shows to a non-existent audience. They wouldn&#8217;t, would they? I cannot think of a more horrible and outrageous waste of license fee payers&#8217; money, unless maybe they dressed Jeremy Clarkson in a jumpsuit knitted from Waitrose organic fresh pasta.</p>
<p>The people who watch such unentertaining forms of entertainment are often old ones, who &#8211; poor things &#8211; have nothing better to do than watch an annoying man in a scarf examining the dusty, unwanted ceramics of the healthy people of Rotherham. Often, I suppose, the televisions will be muted, just on in the background &#8211; perhaps the viewer cannot work their lamp, and uses the television to see their knitting. Perhaps the television is in a waiting room, or a dental surgery, or both, or perhaps it&#8217;s in the post office or a shop selling televisions.</p>
<p>But surely, nobody actually sits down with a cup of peppermint tea and some biscuits to concentrate on watching a whole episode of <cite>Flog It!</cite>, or <cite>Bargain Hunt</cite>, or <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dickinson%27s_Real_Deal"><cite>Dickinson&#8217;s Real Deal</cite></a>, or one of those other beastly things? Nobody in their right mind would do such a thing.</p>
<p>Actually, that&#8217;s what I did yesterday &#8211; with the accompanying snack and hot beverage and everything.</p>
<p>Before you get really worried, I should impress that this was not entirely my own decision. I was with my grandmother, and it would&#8217;ve been rude to . But that doesn&#8217;t mean I didn&#8217;t watch it &#8211; I did watch it, with my very own pair of eyes and everything.</p>
<p>It was, suffice to say, not the best television I&#8217;ve watched this year. Not the worst either, because I was in the bath during that blasted <cite>Piers Morgan On Dubai</cite> thing and I suppose overhearing a muffled version of the bulgy-faced prat rhapsodising about Dubai counts as watching it &#8211; it&#8217;s not too far removed from using a telly that&#8217;s been wounded by heavy objects chucked in anger. Because of course, nobody can properly watch Piers Morgan for more than one minute without spontaneously combusting in a ball of rage.</p>
<p>My grandmother did admit that <cite>Flog It!</cite> is sort of crap. And it is. But, incredibly, that doesn&#8217;t make it impossible to try and squeeze some enjoyment out of the show. I didn&#8217;t fall asleep.</p>
<p>First of all, there are the scarves. For some reason, the geezers on <cite>Flog It</cite> all wear scarves. And then suddenly the scarf is gone. And then it&#8217;s back again. Not sure why that might be interesting &#8211; perhaps it&#8217;s the swinging motion of the scarf as its owner moves, which somehow has a bit of a hypnotic effect.</p>
<p>Then, there is something that had my grandmother screaming at the television. &#8220;She&#8217;s wearing a different jumper! Her eye make-up has changed! He was wearing a scarf!&#8221;</p>
<p>It&#8217;s true. There is a mysterious thing happening with the &#8220;contestants&#8221; &#8211; their appearances seem to change, and it can be horribly confusing who is who. It&#8217;s enough to drive a person mad, it really is. My guess is that it&#8217;s something to do with the way the show is produced, but it&#8217;s really to boring for it to be plausible for me to even consider giving my hypothesis to those of you who have somehow not yet fallen asleep.</p>
<p>Also, the programme seems to be interspersed with shots of the healthy Rochester, Bolton, Southend or <em>wherever the programme is being filmed today</em> inhabitants doing entirely random things &#8211; waving their arms about, picking their noses&#8230; odd.</p>
<p>Oh well. Suffice to say, I&#8217;m off to arrange my sock collection in order of fibre density. I still haven&#8217;t decided whether to do it in ascending or descending order.</p>

<p>Also, why didn&#8217;t David Dickinson&#8217;s parents call him Richard? Perhaps he has an older brother.</p>
