title: Docked a who
---

<p>When I was little I would travel to school on a bicycle that was propelled by my father. My father would breathe audibly. I decided that this audible breathing was my father saying &#8220;poor pears&#8221; over and over again.</p>
<p>Well, why not? Pears have a hard life. In the United Kingdom and Australasia, the metaphorical term &#8220;pear-shaped&#8221; can refer to something that has gone wrong (it&#8217;s thought to be from where the phrase &#8220;tits-up&#8221; is derived). When applied to people, the term can mean &#8220;wide at the hips&#8221;, which may be negative. Obviously there some the positive meanings &#8211; ladies with wide hips are associated with fertility, and were frequently portrayed in certain prehistoric statuettes &#8211; and neutral ones &#8211; horticulturalist Alan Van Dyke coined the phrase in 1731, when he compared the shape of the cashew and the avocado to that of a pear &#8211; but there&#8217;s still no denying that pears have a miserable time.</p>
<p>Of course, my father doesn&#8217;t give a toss about the plight of an an edible pomaceous fruit. He was just breathing noisily.</p>
<p>When I was still little, there was a time when a cousin of mine (who comes from France) and I argued over the identity of a plastic figurine (Playmobil). &#8220;It&#8217;s a duck,&#8221; said my cousin. &#8220;It&#8217;s a cow,&#8221; said I. How could it possibly be a duck? It had four legs and no beak. Has this lad, the son of a farmer, ever seen a duck? What a wally. You couldn&#8217;t make it up.</p>
<p>Then it struck me. It was a dog. He was saying &#8220;it&#8217;s a dog&#8221;. And he was right.</p>
<p>Recently, my science teacher said something along the lines of this:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Remember, there are many different types of bond &#8211; intermolecular, covalent, James. Don&#8217;t just say &#8220;strong bonds&#8221; or you&#8217;ll be Doctor Mark.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>And I thought this:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Who the hell is Doctor Mark?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Is he some kind of byword for problems? You know, a bit like &#8220;Gordon Bennett&#8221;. Maybe being &#8220;Doctor Mark&#8221; is like having &#8220;gone pear-shaped&#8221;.</p>
<p>Then it struck me. Everything became clear. It was as though a lightbulb had been lifted from my head. As quick-witted readers will have guessed, my science teacher meant &#8220;docked a mark&#8221;.</p>
<p>All was well. I was able to understand my science teacher. It was a leap forward. But then he went and mentioned a person who had obtained a doctoral degree. I will not continue with this, because it would be tedious; and besides, my head has kind of exploded.</p>
