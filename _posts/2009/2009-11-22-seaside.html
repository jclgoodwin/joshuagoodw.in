<p>We did a walk a while ago. I won&#8217;t go on and on about how long it was, even though it was long by many people&#8217;s standards, because you&#8217;re probably a frightfully mettlesome athletic person who does such walks for breakfast. I must say that I didn&#8217;t find it remotely difficult.</p>
<p>We went to the seaside and walked along the side of the sea to another seaside town. There we ate some disappointing food at a caf√© restaurant place, before walking all the way back. Good times, definitely.</p>
<p>Here are some pictures what I done while I was doing the walk. Everybody likes pictures. Some of these are a bit pretentiously unremarkable, and the whole thing&#8217;s a bit like The Emperor&#8217;s New Clothes, but that doesn&#8217;t matter.</p>

<p>This one for people who enjoy seeing rocks that, if you squint and have a warped understanding of what a willy looks like, look a bit like willies.</p>
