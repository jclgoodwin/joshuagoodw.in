title: Under the weather
---

<p>Oh, the summer. What a glorious time of the year that is. The sun, the heat, the asparagus&#8230; every single aspect of the summer makes me weep with joy.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s the summer now. I should be dancing in the fields, smearing clotted cream all over my body, drizzling olive oil over undercooked potatoes, filling jam jars with sand, relaxing in my special deck-chair made by sticking truffles together with bull sperm. But I&#8217;m not.</p>
<p>Instead, I&#8217;m cowering indoors, blowing my nose, sneezing, sniffing, coughing, beating myself about the head, praying for some Strepsils. Outside is horribly soggy and drippy and damp. If I attempted to take my deck chair out there, the water would cause it to dissolve in a rather pathetic manner, like some kind of evil monster at the end of some kind of fantastic book once the hero has managed to stab it with a gleaming bejewelled butter knife/sword. I&#8217;ve got a cold, and the weather is quite dismal.</p>
<p>No, I&#8217;m not asking for sympathy or anything. I wouldn&#8217;t dream of it. That would be out of order. However, I am extremely unfortunate, and I don&#8217;t deserve any of it, and it&#8217;s just so unbearably horrible.</p>
<p>But actually I&#8217;m quite lucky. A caveman would be rather worried, in a situation like the one I&#8217;m in. He or she would assume that such a stroke of bad luck is the result of the gods. &#8220;Maybe,&#8221; one might wonder, &#8220;it&#8217;s punishment for spilling nectarine juice all over the newspaper.&#8221; Because, you see, I did spill nectarine juice all over the newspaper the other day &#8211; very naughty indeed of me.</p>
<p>But I know that it&#8217;s OK. I&#8217;m not a caveman, believe me. I&#8217;m acutely aware that there&#8217;s no correlation between my clumsiness with fruit and the weather/health situation (unless I choke on the fruit, or eat too much of it, or douse evil acidic lemon/lime/grapefruit/orange/satsuma/tangerine/clementine juice all over my eyes ). Sacrificing a goat won&#8217;t help to rectify things, and nor will doing a special dance. There&#8217;s nothing I can do. I just need to sit back, relax, have a box of tissues nearby, and wait for things to improve. They will, I&#8217;m sure.</p>
<p>What&#8217;s more, sneezing is one of my favourite things to do. It&#8217;s fantastic. There is no greater pleasure. This says more about the tragic nature of my life than anything, but come on, you can&#8217;t deny that sneezing is fantastic and excellent and stuff.</p>
<p>Unless it&#8217;s one of those big ones, which require one to open one&#8217;s mouth so wide that it&#8217;s very painful indeed. Or worse still, one of those horrible ones, where a blob of mucus sprouts up in your hand out of thin air. They&#8217;re disgusting, gruesome, vile, and so on. I apologise sincerely for bringing up (!) the subject here. They&#8217;re the work of Satan, every single one of them. I don&#8217;t want to sneeze like that. Stop this bout of extremely mild ill health, immediately, The Gods. <em>Now!</em></p>
<p>Come to think of it, maybe a little goat sacrifice would help. Just a small one. It can&#8217;t do any harm, can it? It&#8217;s worth a try, I suppose. Yeah. That&#8217;s what I&#8217;ll do.</p>
<p>No it isn&#8217;t.</p>
<p>Yes it is.</p>
<p>No!</p>
<p>Sundae.</p>
