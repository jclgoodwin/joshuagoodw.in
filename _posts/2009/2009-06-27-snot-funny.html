<p>Apparently like some guy died or something, and some people have been making a small fuss about it and that. &#8220;Blame it on the boogie,&#8221; one said, and I disagree with that statement. Nasal effluent, in my opinion, is completely and utterly blameless. And I have decided that it is my duty to explain why it is so very innocent.</p>
<p>I understand folks&#8217; arguments. I can see how a bogey could kill a person. His nose might have been blocked. But this could have been easily and painlessly sorted out in a jiffy with a quick blow of the nose. And if no tissues where available, he could have simply breathed through his mouth to avoid death. It is no fault of a bogey.</p>
<p>I suppose <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Par_(score)#Bogey">they may have been talking about golf</a>. And I&#8217;m happy to blame golf. I don&#8217;t really like golf. For starters, it&#8217;s the only game I can think of that&#8217;s named after a Volkswagen hatchback &#8211; well, I suppose there&#8217;s polo &#8211; and there are few games named after Volkswagen hatchbacks for a good reason. The good reason for the scarcity of games named after Volkswagen hatchbacks being that it&#8217;s idiotic to name a game after a Volkswagen hatchback. And it just so happens that the name&#8217;s idiocy is quite appropriate for golf &#8211; the name is a bad start, and it rolls quickly downhill from there. Like a golf ball, really, about to plop into a lake or whatever.</p>
<p>But enough about golf. I&#8217;m quite confident that nobody is silly enough to blame golf. Much as I&#8217;d like golf to be to blame, that&#8217;s just biased ridiculousness, and a judge would never be allowed to behave as immaturely as I am behaving. Golf is no killer, no matter how horrid it is.</p>
<p>If a nose blockage really was responsible, which as I have said is very unlikely, then I&#8217;m not sure a single bogey can be to blame. Much like a playing card, a single bogey is not of much use if you&#8217;re trying to cause death through nose blockage. But when you have a whole community of playing cards, you can play bridge or solitaire or whatever game you fancy; the same is true with bogeys, although of course the bogeys must be used not to play with (that would be disgusting) but rather to block the nose of a famous pop-star, killing said pop-star. It should at least be &#8220;blame it on the double-bogey&#8221;. I wouldn&#8217;t be shocked to find out that it was a quadruple-bogey, in fact.</p>
<p>That all sounded like a sensible argument. But, come to think of it, the deceased did have a most peculiar artificial nose, which may have been more easy-to-block than most noses on the market. A sole trader bogey could have been all that was needed for those clogs to pop.</p>
<p>What&#8217;s more, it could be a case of the straw that broke the camel&#8217;s back. Or rather the bogey that turned the nose from being partially- to completely-blocked. In that case, the single bogey is to blame. Someone bang that naughty, murdering bogey to rights.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m going to change the subject now. There, I just changed the subject. The new subject is my being on Facebook. You see, I seem to be on Facebook. I&#8217;m on Facebook. Why not befriend me on Facebook? Here&#8217;s why:</p>
<p>&#8230;</p>
<p>Oh look, there appear to be precisely zero reasons to not befriend me on Facebook. So, hop to it. Befriend me on Facebook. Now! But only if you want to. I don&#8217;t want to force you into anything. You&#8217;re free to not do it if you don&#8217;t want to. I&#8217;m fine with that. As long as you do it now. <em>Now!</em></p>
