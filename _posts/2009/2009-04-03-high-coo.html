<p>Writing haiku things.<br />
  Just seventeen syllables.<br />
  It&#8217;s really easy.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>So easy, in fact, that I don&#8217;t want to write anything else in this article post thing. That would be disgusting &#8211; taking the easy option is very naughty. Also, I&#8217;m about to embark on an evening of all sorts of thrilling stuff, and thus am filled with fear that I might be forced to break this month&#8217;s exciting daily post challenge &#8211; yeah, it&#8217;s a bit like the <cite>Daily Cooks Challenge</cite>, only without both Antony Worrall Thompson and the mildly dodgy punctuation situation.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m expectant of plenty of comments on this, for it appears to be a great unwritten rule that less words means more comments. Let&#8217;s disprove it. Damn, no, that was the wrong thing to say &#8211; my ego had better get the Vaseline back out.</p>
<p>Share your haikus or something, cretins. Go on, you know you want to.</p>
