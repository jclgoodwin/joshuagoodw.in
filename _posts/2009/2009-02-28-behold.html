<p>I am stiff today. Like a big pair of creaky scissors that has not seen a drop of lubrication since the moon was last blue.</p>
<p>I blame an hour of relentless bounding over benches, dangling from ropes, arm-wrestling, and other such things. Oh, and sweating. Lots of sweating. Lots and lots of sweating. Lots and lots and lots of sweating. I will not go on because that would just be too silly a task for even a silly person like me.</p>
<p>Anyway, this stiffness, a result of lactic acid or something, means that I am waddling amusingly like an infant who&#8217;s nappy has become full of excrement. Only, without the nasty smell, I hope. It&#8217;s good.</p>
<p>Here are some treats for those of you who enjoy by pictures taken at night out of the window of a car being driven speedily along a dull motorway.</p>

<p>They&#8217;re just my favourites, a tiny pinch of salt taken from a big heavy brute of a bag. I must say, picking my favourite useless photograph of some blurred headlights is a bit like picking my favourite part of the wall. But actually, I do have a favourite part of the wall &#8211; it&#8217;s that part over there. Isn&#8217;t it lovely? Look at that paint!</p>
<p>Snazzy super-cool people with big towering black cameras will be expecting me to mutter something about a long exposure. So, there you go folks &#8211; I just mentioned a long exposure.</p>
<p>Really, why is it that you enjoy such banal things as the ones above? Weirdo.</p>
<p>Be well.</p>
