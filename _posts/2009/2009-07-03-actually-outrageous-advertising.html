title: Actually, outrageous advertising
---

<p>A few hours after releasing into the wild <a href="/2009/07/not-effective-advertising">yesterday&#8217;s thing, which (perhaps disturbingly) has already attracted a swarm of Googlers hungry for some exciting bull udder sucking action</a>, I found myself, incredibly, at some kind of social event and in the position of having one of those big plastic bottles full of Tango right under my nose. I was on the ginger beer mostly, but decided to have a little of the orange stuff to both irritate my dentist and test out the claims made</p>
<p>Nothing happened. My teeth kind of hurt a little bit more than usually (!) today, but I was in no way compelled to suck a bull&#8217;s udder, and certainly never found myself doing so. And, in case things are not clear, I normally have absolutely no desire to suck a bull&#8217;s udder either.</p>
<p>Obviously I am relieved. When I sipped that Tango, my heart was filled with fear that the advertisement&#8217;s claims would ring true, and I would sob endlessly, wiping my eyes on the embarrassing humiliation of having sucked a bull&#8217;s udder.</p>
<p>But I am brave, like some kind of warrior or something, and I&#8217;m glad that I was because I had nothing to worry about. I was fine. It&#8217;s now more probable than it was before that I&#8217;ll turn into a tortoise because of my consumption of something containing the evil toxic mutant chemical aspartame &#8211; not a good thing, because <em>aspartame</em> sounds a bit like <cite>Meet The Spartans</cite> which is a terrible film &#8211; but that has very little to do with bulls&#8217; udders.</p>
<p>Since there is clearly no real risk of unwillingly sucking a bull&#8217;s udder at the will of some Tango, why are they putting off potential drinkers? The only thing I can think of is that there are some people who like the idea of sucking a bull&#8217;s udder &#8211; good luck to them &#8211; and the drink manufacturer is targeting them specifically. A clever idea &#8211; if one does something unusual (such as making special drinks that can encourage people to suck bulls&#8217; udders), then it is easy for one to be the best at doing that unusual thing.</p>
<p>All very well, but as my highly scientific trials have confirmed, there is no correlation between willingness to suck a bull&#8217;s udder and consumption of Tango. All those mutant bull fetishists out there will be devastated to discover, after having spent some of their hard-earned money on Tango, that the claims are false. And it&#8217;s illegal to make false claims in an advertisement. Disgusting.</p>
<p>&#8220;But,&#8221; you say smugly, your eyes quivering because you think you&#8217;ve just out-witted me, &#8220;the poster stated that <em>too much</em> Tango caused udder-sucking.&#8221;</p>
<p>I, being a consumer champion who kicks aspartame in the balls and the like, would argue that even the most meagre sniff of aspartame-rich evil Tango, what some see as the devil&#8217;s sweat and wee mixed together with a pinch of poster paint and poured into a horrible plastic bottle, is too much. Actually drinking the stuff, as I did, is venturing horribly-deep into the forest of <em>excessivenessosity</em>.</p>
<p>I would end with a hilarious thing, but I can&#8217;t think of any hilarious thing with which to end.</p>
<p>Actually, I know just the thing. <span class="caps">COCK</span>. Ha ha, I said &#8220;<span class="caps">COCK</span>&#8221;!</p>
