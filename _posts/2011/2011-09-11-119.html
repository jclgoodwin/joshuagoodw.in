<p>Ten years ago today, it was the afternoon here (hey, it still is) and I was on a bus. The bus stopped, and as I landed on the pavement, someone was saying something about something going in one side of something and not coming back out the other.</p>
<p>Naturally, my first thought was that it was a hedgehog that they were talking about. Hedgehogs were big on the zeitgeist, and a hedgehog sounds like just the animal to crawl under a shrub and not come out the other side, so it made perfect sense.</p>
<p>Well, what they say about &#8220;assume&#8221; is correct, because that wasn&#8217;t right at all. In fact, as as I soon learned, it had been that second aeroplane, startlingly caught live on the television over someone&#8217;s shoulder, gliding into the second tower. Not a hedgehog. The plane seemed to dissolve as it flew behind the building &#8211; and then you realised that it hadn&#8217;t gone behind at all. And then all that followed happened &#8211; and continues to happen.</p>
<p>I wish it could have been hedgehogs.</p>
