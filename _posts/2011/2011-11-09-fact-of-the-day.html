<p>The words that John F Kennedy spoke in that speech &#8211; &#8220;Ich bin ein Berliner&#8221; &#8211; showing solidarity with the people of Berlin did not translate to &#8220;I am a doughnut&#8221; after all. </p>
<p><a href="http://www.quora.com/Did-JFK-claim-to-be-a-donut">Martin Strohmeier points out</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Do English-speaking people think that someone who says &#8216;I am a New Yorker&#8217; is a magazine?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>My question is this, then: what do you say if you really are a doughnut?</p>
