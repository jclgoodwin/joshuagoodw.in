title: '&#8216;Our philosophy&#8217;'
---

<p><a href="/2010/01/unleash-the-beauty-of-nature">The last time</a> this happened, in a stab at some kind of comic effect, I cleverly pretended to misunderstand some literary devices that had been employed by the little men who make bottles of shampoo.</p>
<p>Today, I noticed this heading on the reverse of a bottle of TRESemmé conditioner (with silk protein and collagen, you know):</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Our philosophy</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Their philosophy? Why do they need one of those? All I wanted was to wash my hair, and they went and came out with this. I know barely a jot about the field &#8211; isn&#8217;t the racing car driver Jason Plato one of the philosophers? &#8211; but I wonder exactly what TRESemmé&#8217;s philosophy is.</p>
<p>Maybe it pertains to their advertising on the television, in which a wheaty-haired man in a shirt moves his lips out of time with the audio track? Or do they just think it&#8217;s really important to help Alan Titchmarsh achieve <a href="/2010/08/the-audacity-of-soap">his goal of having</a> oozy skin like a snail&#8217;s?</p>
<p>We don&#8217;t need to wonder, because underneath that heading is written the philosophy itself:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>From our origins in salons around the world, we&#8217;ve always had a simple vision: to create stylist-tested, salon-quality products without the salon price tag, so you can experience that salon feeling everyday.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>There. Immanuel &#8220;Jeremy&#8221; Kant lives on.</p>
<p>(On the bottles of conditioner and accompanying shampoo, the colon quoted above is erroneously in fact a semicolon. On an apparently newer bottle of hairspray that I looked at, the mistake is not there, so I have given the benefit of the doubt. Because I am nice.)</p>
