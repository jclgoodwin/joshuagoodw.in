<p><a href="http://wrapperrhymes.tumblr.com/">WrapperRhymes</a> is a collection of poems written on wrappers. For example, Ted Hughes <a href="http://wrapperrhymes.tumblr.com/post/6034562348">wrote</a> on the sheath of a Tunnock&#8217;s Caramel Wafer in 1986:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>To have swallowed a Crocodile<br />
  Would make anybody smile</p>
<p>But to swallow a Caramel Wafer<br />
  Is safer.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It scrolls endlessly; they are of varying quality.</p>
