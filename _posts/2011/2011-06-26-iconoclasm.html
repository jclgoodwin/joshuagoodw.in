title: Iconoclasm

<p>I use Gmail for doing emails, and many other people do too. It&#8217;s quite good &#8211; well, it must be, because I don&#8217;t take these choices lightly &#8211; but one fly in the ointment is the web interface&#8217;s favicon. Doesn&#8217;t it look all dirty and horrible?</p>

<p>Forget it, I told myself, it&#8217;s not worth it. But while I struggle to remember things like my PIN number and Clive Anderson&#8217;s surname, it&#8217;s not easy to forget such dirt and such horror, which is a rotten shame.</p>
<p>Then I found out that a man named Tyler Sticka, who is a proper icon designer, has made <a href="http://userscripts.org/users/tylersticka">some userscripts</a> to replace several websites&#8217; favicons with prettier alternatives of his own design. I&#8217;m not a proper icon designer, but that trivia never stopped anyone, so I decided to have a go myself. My masterpiece is less dirty and less horrible, and more closely resembles the actual Gmail logo.</p>

<p>Lazily bastardising Sticka&#8217;s source code &#8211; I hope he doesn&#8217;t mind &#8211; I made <a href="http://userscripts.org/scripts/show/103704">a userscript</a>, to replace the official icon with my improved version. It works with <a href="http://www.google.com/chrome">Google Chrome</a> (natively), <a href="https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/greasemonkey/">Greasemonkey</a> for Firefox, and <a href="http://8-p.info/greasekit/">GreaseKit</a> for WebKit, and probably other things too. Sadly, it&#8217;s not very reliable, and often the original icon will still be displayed, so I don&#8217;t know what to do. Is consistent dirty horror better than erratically flip-flopping between dirty horror and something a bit more pleasant?</p>
<p>All that remains is the replacement of the hyphens in the title bar with typographically correct en dashes. Then we will have solved all of the world&#8217;s problems.</p>
