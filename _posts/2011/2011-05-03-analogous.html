<p>Two years ago &#8211; two years! &#8211; I did a little series of blog posts exposing bad analogies. Well, I have uncovered <a href="/2009/03/bad-analogy-number-1">the first</a>, in which I attacked a man from off of Smashing Magazine, which is not even a magazine but a website, but there must have been more, right? Was it really quite that short-lived, or did I delete the other ones in horror? If I did censor myself, creating a situation like when Stalin went to the moon, my writing must have been pretty awful, because the aforelinked&#8217;s survival displays magnificently just how low the bar is set.</p>
<p>(Smashing Magazine can&#8217;t have been too upset about my poorly phrased exposé, cos I was sent a free book, of expensively stitched non-fiction cardboard leaves, that subsequent winter. I still haven&#8217;t written a review of it like what I was expected to.)</p>
<p>I mention all this because of a thing that <a href="http://monster-island.org/tinashumor/humor/analogy.html" title="High school schoolchildren's 'worst' analogies">the Washington Post did in 1995</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>His fountain pen was so expensive it looked as if someone had grabbed the pope, turned him upside down and started writing with the tip of his big pointy hat.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Her artistic sense was exquisitely refined, like someone who can tell butter from I Can’t Believe It’s Not Butter.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><a href="http://www.clusterflock.org/2011/05/56-worst-analogies-of-high-school-students.html">Via clusterflock</a>, who linked to <a href="http://www.losteyeball.com/index.php/2007/06/19/56-worstbest-analogies-of-high-school-students/">this blog post</a>, which hubristically claims to have the complete list of analogies, despite having clearly missed the first one quoted above for starters.</p>
<p>As everyone is wont to point out, &#8220;bad&#8221; is a hasty word. The first one is greatly enriched by dint of &#8220;grabbed&#8221; looking like &#8220;groped&#8221;. I do maintain that my long-ago discovery what I made remains far better, obviously. In your face, the Washington Post.</p>
