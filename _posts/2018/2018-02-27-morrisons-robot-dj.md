The beleaguered supermarket Morrisons has attracted attention -- well, my attention -- by actually playing bearable music in its shops.[^1]
It's not even just Van Morrison, Morrissey, and, uh, Maurice Gibb.

I don't know why this re-occurred to be the other day, but it did.
I remember one particular occasion when I even used my mobile telephone to, well, I believe the verb is "to Shazam".

It was in the Acomb branch, I remember.
My [Google Play Sound Search](https://myactivity.google.com/page?page=soundsearch) history suggests that it was <cite>A Long Time</cite> by Mayer Hawthorne, and it was in June 2015.
I can't find a record of a card transaction in my bank account, but it's a safe bet that I bought some potato fardels.

Cool story, bro.

Well, serendipitiously,

So now we know.
