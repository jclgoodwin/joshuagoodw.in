[After I last mentioned trousers](https://joshuagoodw.in/2018/03/aspirational-trousers), who knew I'd return to the subject so quickly? Certainly not I.

But then, who knew there'd be so many goings-on in such a short space of time?

First, an upsetting development regarding my Hiut jeans. A sort of hole has opened up around what might be called the "seat of the pants" area. This could be used as evidence for some cojones-based flattery, but the more pedestrian story is that I ride a bicycle quite a lot.

There is [this on the Hiut Denim Co website](https://hiutdenim.co.uk/pages/repairs):

> We stand by what we make. And keep standing by it even when things go wrong. That's why we offer a free repairs policy for life on our jeans.

Brilliant! But:

> We can't offer this service on the Tech Jean as it can't be darned liked a pair of jeans can.

My jeans are a Tech Jean. Oh well, fair enough I suppose. Now, _some_ bloggers would probably try to argue about semantics -- what _is_ a pair of jeans? -- there's the word "jean" in "Tech Jean", right? -- but that wouldn't really befit my brand. If it can't be darned, it can't be darned. (Maybe the word "tech" is an allusion to contemporary consumer electronic products, [which are difficult to repair](https://www.ifixit.com/). Ooh.)

The other thing: [<cite>Harpers BAZAAR</cite> reports](https://www.harpersbazaar.com.au/fashion/meghan-markle-hiut-denim-waitlist-16021):

> Meghan Markle's influence is being felt in full force by one Welsh company, who have skyrocketed to fame thanks to the <cite>Suits</cite> star.
>
> Markle wore a pair of Hiut denim jeans during her official visit to Cardiff and, according to the company's co-founder, the brand has not been the same ever since.

The only possible explanation is that this blog has an acolyte embedded deep within the palace. Hello, acolyte! What's more, I think it adds to the growing body of evidence that the royal family is irrelevant, and blogging is much more relevant. The famous actor's with-fianc√©e trip to Cardiff _was_ back in January, months before I wrote anything, but I don't really understand what difference that makes.
