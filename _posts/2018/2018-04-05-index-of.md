["Open Directories Are the Only Interesting Places Left on the Internet"][mthrbrd], writes Jason Koebler at <cite>Motherboard</cite>.
That's a needlessly provocative headline, but it's a fair point.
Searching with your favourite search engine for "index of" "parent directory" and something apposite is often a good way to surface lists of interesting files.

But it reminds me: perhaps the clearest sign of something being good is when unpleasant people start to exploit it for selfish reasons. So it is with directory listings.

I could speak from personal experience, but instead [here's a Boards of Canada fan posting on a forum][boc] about coming across what appeared to be an Aladdin's cave of rare tracks, but was in fact a fake listing generated using the [MusicBrainz](https://musicbrainz.org/) database to trick people into completing "offers" (enter a thoroughly dubious competition or survey -- give your details to some spammers).

Who's behind these sites? Is it like [the Macedonian fake news complex][macedonia]?
Do they make much money?
A key question for them must be "how do you sleep at night?"
Yet I can't help but admire their plucky entrepreneurialism.

The doyen of the fake "index of MP3" game [was surely wallywashis.name][wally], which no longer appears to exist -- but there are others left, like unknownsecret.info.
They're all a bit different, but share these rather brilliant terms and conditions:

> You must brush your teeth and floss at least twice daily.

> You agree to reject critical thought by condemning it as the realm of conspiracy theorists and cranks.

> You must not harbor expectations of downloading mp3 content from this site.

(I can't really do it justice just by quoting excerpts. Seek out the whole thing yourself.)

> The webmaster may ask for collateral in the form of your first born child as a sign of good faith before permitting you to use this website.

Ye gods, [the "Herod clause"][herod] is real.

I think all of the writing is a beautiful work of art, subtly hinting that the thing is a scam.
