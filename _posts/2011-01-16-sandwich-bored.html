title: '&#8216;Sandwich bored&#8217;'
---

<p>Hugh Fearnley-Whittingstall doesn’t like sandwiches. And no, this isn’t one of those pathetic things where I continue, “Actually, he <em>loves</em> sandwiches!” The truth is this: he genuinely doesn’t like sandwiches.</p>
<p>Of course, you may wonder who exactly I think I am. Mr Fearnley-Whittingstall’s spokesperson, perhaps? No, actually, and such a delusion has never existed in my mind, ever, I promise. The idea of a creepy individual becoming convinced of a close relationship with the rustic chef, based purely on his friendly style of writing and presenting, even if he (as I suspect) doesn’t draw multiplication signs at the bottom of correspondences, is not inconceivable, but my stability is such that I am far enough from being that individual.</p>
<p>I neither know nor claim to know Hugh Fearnley-Whittingstall, but I did see <a href="http://www.channel4.com/programmes/river-cottage/episode-guide/series-14/episode-6">a thing occur inside the television</a> that exposed him as a brazenly extremist anti-sandwich lobbyist pillock. Perhaps he was putting on an act, perhaps the film was misleadingly edited, perhaps in real life he’s a normal person who&#8217;ll be one day caught red-handed – literally red-handed &#8211; with the tomato ketchup of a bacon sandwich dribbling down his hands, but when I looked into his eyes, I saw convincing enough evidence that he really meant it. It was completely terrifying.</p>
<p>&#8220;The end of the sandwich is nigh,&#8221; said Fearnley-Whittingstall, bold as brass, on national television, as we watched him standing in a selection of public places, with a sandwich board strapped to his shoulders, on which was written a light-hearted punning message. &#8220;Sandwich? Bored?&#8221;</p>

<p>Maybe he&#8217;s right. Brackish butter, raw white and &#8220;malted&#8221; breads, wheat-induced lethargy, unsustainable plastic packages and tuna are the bane of my life. Certainly, buying something from a shop is a sticky minefield, and I&#8217;m sure that all will agree that I&#8217;m not offensively trivialising that word.</p>
<p>But it doesn&#8217;t have to be that way. You can still have a sandwich without butter, without wheat, without tuna, without being bored &#8211; and there can be no better way to stick it to the man and recycle leftover items than by pouring them between thick hunks of the &#8220;staff of life&#8221; to form a home-made one.</p>
<p>Weeks later, again inside the television, on the same channel (the fourth one), Jamie Oliver appears, donned in a cap. (This must have been because there was sunlight incident on his eyes, even though he was indoors, with his back to the window, and a sunset has recently happened. He must have abnormally sensitive eyes.) Mr Oliver makes a sandwich, using a great phallic baguette and some steaks of meat, a process that involves whole minutes of cooking with pans and an oven and everything. This is not the shop-bought, floppy horror that Hugh means to deride, but it is still a sandwich (albeit one that strays precariously near to “panini” or “hamburger” territory), and mustn’t be overlooked. What kind of messages are the Channel 4 channel sending out? Mixed, hypocritical ones, that&#8217;s what.</p>
<p>Free with today&#8217;s <cite>Observer</cite> is a thin, pocket-sized (A6?) pamphlet, written by Fearnley-Whittingstall himself, detailing the preparation of some exciting and healthy lunches. One of these involves placing some food on a sheet of bread, to form a sort of sandwich, which represents a complete double-standard. Better still, in the aforementioned <cite>River Cottage</cite> television show, which can be <a href="http://www.channel4.com/programmes/river-cottage/4od#3140236">viewed</a> online, the disgusting anti-sandwich propaganda was actually preceded by a recipe for &#8220;the ultimate cheese sandwich&#8221;. It is a searingly flip-flop U-turn attitude that makes the whole <cite>Blue Peter</cite> cat-naming scandal look innocent.</p>
<p>Maybe it&#8217;s good to see this sort of pluralism, this free speech, and Channel 4 should be applauded for giving a voice to different sides of the argument. However, that erodes away at my point, and I would argue that the balance is not representative &#8211; there&#8217;s a silent majority, with too much of a voice being given to the occasional militant anti-sandwich freaks. Perhaps it&#8217;s symptomatic of the theories about every television executive regularly eating mouthfuls of cocaines, yeah? There. Sort it out, please. Thank you.</p>
