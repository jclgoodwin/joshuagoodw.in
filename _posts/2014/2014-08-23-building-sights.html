<p><a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/bbcfour/collections/p01s0hpy/post-war-architecture">&#8220;For this collection, Janet Street-Porter has selected programmes about post-war architecture&#8221;</a> is a bit of a startling sentence at first, but it really needn&#8217;t be.</p>
<p>Some highlights: <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/p01rrc9j">Jools Holland going about Canary Wharf in a vibrant blazer</a>, <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/p01rqxwc">Norman Foster climbing on a jumbo jet</a>, and <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/p01rqrd0">a bit about the visually arresting house Street-Porter herself got designed</a>.</p>
<p>(Isn&#8217;t it cool of the BBC to make available things from their archives like this? Brilliant.)</p>
