<p>My favourite sentence in Robert Louis Stevenson&#8217;s <cite>Strange Case of Dr Jekyll and Mr Hyde</cite>:</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;If he be Mr Hyde,&#8221; he had thought, &#8220;I shall be Mr Seek.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>!</p>
<p>I tell myself it&#8217;s research for any hypothetical review of Windows 8, and also for choosing between the different choices of <a href="http://jekyllrb.com/" title="Jekyll">static</a> website <a href="http://ringce.com/hyde" title="Hyde">generators</a>.</p>
