title: Google as a baboon
---

<p>Google is like <a href="http://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/12/04/googles-intelligence-is-more-baboon-than-human/255870/">a baboon, reports the</a> <cite>Atlantic</cite>. Inevitably, I am furious, <a href="/2012/04/facebook-elephant">having what is called &#8220;prior art&#8221; when it comes</a> to comparing wild animals to internet companies.</p>
<p>Like a baboon, Google doesn&#8217;t allow the rearrangement of its black upper bar of links, which smells because I never use &#8220;Google Play&#8221; but frequently have to burrow deeply towards the insignificant Google Reader. But I think the article makes a different point.</p>
