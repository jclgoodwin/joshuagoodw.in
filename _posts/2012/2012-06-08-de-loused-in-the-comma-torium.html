---

<p>An appendage to <a href="http://opinionator.blogs.nytimes.com/2012/04/09/fanfare-for-the-comma-man/">a drab article</a> in the <cite>New York Times</cite>:</p>
<blockquote><p>An earlier version of this article misstated the length of time E.B. White wrote for The New Yorker as five centuries.</p></blockquote>
<p>Bonus: don&#8217;t miss <a href="http://opinionator.blogs.nytimes.com/2012/05/21/the-most-comma-mistakes/">the sequel</a>.</p>
