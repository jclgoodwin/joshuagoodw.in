title: URL shorteners and Twitter
---

<p>Dave Winer, <a href="http://scripting.com/stories/2012/03/03/evershorterUrlshorteners.html">&#8220;Ever-shorter URLs&#8221;</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>We shouldn&#8217;t have to shorten urls. It&#8217;s only because of a fairly selfish and unwise company in San Francisco that we&#8217;re adding an extra layer of fragility to an already loosely-coupled network. Introducing another point of failure.</p></blockquote>
<p>OK.</p>
<blockquote><p>But with all that disclaimed, we still need url-shorteners</p></blockquote>
<p>Or do we? I&#8217;m going to come right out and say that the shortening of URLs <strong>solves nothing</strong> about the internet site Twitter. Let me explain.</p>
<p><span id="more-4902"></span>Here, I compose a tweet containing a long, unshortened URL. Obviously, it&#8217;s longer than 20 characters, but Twitter actually pretends that it&#8217;s just 20 characters long, leaving room for 120 (that&#8217;s the number on the right above the keyboard) more before I reach the limit of 140 characters:</p>
<p><img src="/wp/wp-content/uploads/2012/03/long20.png" alt="" class="aligncenter size-full" /></p>
<p>Here, I instead use that URL in a shortened form &#8211; one of the Dave Winer&#8217;s very clever new ones, announced in the aforelinked post. It is even shorter than 20 characters, but guess what:</p>
<p><img src="/wp/wp-content/uploads/2012/03/short20.png" alt="" class="aligncenter size-full" /></p>
<p>Again, Twitter pretends that it&#8217;s 20 characters long, even though it isn&#8217;t. Try it at home if you don&#8217;t believe me. (Some Twitter clients&#8217; character counting mechanisms might not be up-to-date.) Shortened or not, any URL is now worth exactly 20 characters in Twitter&#8217;s eyes. It is weird and confusing, but doesn&#8217;t it at least mean we don&#8217;t need URL shorteners after all?</p>
<p><strong>Update:</strong> 20 seemed like a very specific number of characters &#8211; to be clear, it is because the t.co URLs that are now wrapped around every link are currently all themselves 20 characters long. (They will presumably get gradually longer over time.) <a href="http://twitter.com/davewiner/status/177432939892703233">Sometimes the shorter original URLs do slip through the t.co net</a>, but it seems to be a bug not a feature.</p>
<p><strong>Update:</strong> Apparently <a href="http://twitter.com/davewiner/status/177465502438928385">Dave Winer&#8217;s particular URL shortener &#8220;returns hitcounts&#8221;</a>, enabling a slightly useful &#8220;top 40&#8243; chart. But I don&#8217;t believe that all the people pre-shortening URLs are in it for the analytics.</p>
