<p>Not specifically to protest against American handwash, but maybe that as well, I sat hunched over in the dark to do some online piracy last night and I uploaded the result it to YouTube.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, the prickly Gaumont Film Company is in cahoots with YouTube&#8217;s smart algorithms. Even though there are hundreds of clips of their content that have already been uploaded as-is, my own painstakingly compiled derivative work set off some alarms.<sup><a href="#footnote_0_4638" id="identifier_0_4638" class="footnote-link footnote-identifier-link" title="My theory is that the other pirates, in pooing up the aspect ratio as they inevitably do, incidentally outfox the ninja technology. It&rsquo;s a shame that, as an aspect ratio puritan, I believe that no video at all is better than a painfully distorted one.">1</a></sup> So instead I present it here, liberated from the clutches of any corporate silos &#8211; entitled &#8220;James Moriarty versus Norman Stansfield&#8221;:</p>
<p><video controls="controls" preload="none" width="640" height="360" poster="/media/oldman.jpg"><source src="/media/oldman.mp4" type="video/mp4" /><source src="/media/oldman.ogv" type="video/ogg" /></video></p>
<p>(You may download <a href="/media/oldman.mp4">the H.264 file</a> or <a href="/media/oldman.ogv">the Ogg file</a>.)</p>
<p>The prior art is <cite>LÃ©on: The Professional</cite> (Gaumont, 1994) and <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b01b2vl4" title="Sherlock, Series 2, The Reichenbach Fall"><cite>Sherlock</cite></a> (BBC, 2012). (If the owners ask for it to be removed, then of course I will oblige.)</p>
<p>I know, some of the audio is too quiet and some of the audio is too loud. Goldilocks! <em>And</em> this is the <a href="/2012/01/hemlock-soames">second consecutive thing</a> about that darned TV show &#8211; I won&#8217;t continue, I promise.</p>
