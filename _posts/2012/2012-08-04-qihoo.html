<p>Doug Pierce, <a href="http://www.digital-dd.com/qihoo-browser-war/">&#8220;How Qihoo 360 Won the Browser War in China&#8221;</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>An onomatopoeia for the sound of a sneeze, Qihoo is best known for its 360 Safe Guard anti-virus software.</p></blockquote>
<p>Not to be confused with a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Responses_to_sneezing">response to sneezing</a>. But it is true that many of the responses to sneezing, as listed in that Wikipedia article, could be confused for onomatopoeias.</p>
<p>&#8220;Difficult uninstallation&#8221; is listed as one of the things that helped Quihoo 360 to win the browser war in China, and it&#8217;s easy to see why &#8211; everything in <a href="http://www.digital-dd.com/qihoo-browser-war/#attachment_1026">that screenshot</a> seems to be written in some completely foreign language that I can&#8217;t understand, right? Difficult.</p>
