title: Kindle iTunes Match blown out

<p><a href="http://twitter.com/kageman/status/154604054671142912" title="On Twitter">Via Karthick Gopal</a>, here&#8217;s <a href="http://daringfireball.net/2007/11/dum" title="Daring Fireball: DUM">John Gruber writing in 2007</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>Major publishing houses almost certainly would be unwilling to permit Amazon to sell e-books sans DRM, in the same way that music labels were originally unwilling to sell DRM-free music. But so why not bundle the Kindle e-books with the good old-fashioned shareable, preservable, paper books? Change the pitch from “buy digital e-books instead of paper books” to “get a digital Kindle e-book with each paper book you buy from Amazon”.</p></blockquote>
<p>There may never be an iTunes Match for books &#8211; it&#8217;s hard to prove to a machine that you own a book &#8211; and that&#8217;s a shame. But if someone has bought a meatspace book from Amazon, why the heck shouldn&#8217;t they be able to add the electric version for a reduced price? (Some cool indie book publishers already have this model in place.)</p>
<p>That argument in 2012 seems less infallible than it did in 2007. The status quo now encourages a diet richer in electrons, which more being more high-margin than paper is more preferable to the Jeff Bezos Dog Doo-Dah Band. Better for Amazon, but not better better. And Amazon is a scary gorilla that gets what it wants. (Maybe, right there, I have found the problem with capitalism.)</p>
<p>Clearly, this is a somewhere where Waterstone&#8217;s, Barnes &#038; Noble &#8211; the big and still meatiest meatspace booksellers &#8211; could compete in the face of their own dwindling revenues and inferior/imaginary ebook stores. Imagine: <em>If you bought some books from Waterstone&#8217;s, now you can &#8220;copy&#8221; them all onto your hypothetical Waterstone&#8217;s sandwich of plastic for a small price.</em> Why hasn&#8217;t that happened yet? Is it already up someone&#8217;s sleeve? I hope so.</p>
