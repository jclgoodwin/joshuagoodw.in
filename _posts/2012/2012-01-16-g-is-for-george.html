title: G is for George
---

<p>I have a useful template for devising hilarious statements about people whose names can also be used as nouns for other things. For instance: Alan Partridge is not a real partridge; Dr Liam Fox is not a real fox; Bob Crow is not a real crow; Edward Tufte is not a real squirrel; you can’t use Frank Zappa to adjust your television.</p>
<p>George Osborne has been in the news, right, because he is like the chancellor, of the exchequer. He does chancelling, yes, in a chancel, isn’t it? He lives in London, I expect, because that is usually where the politicians live.</p>
<p>The thing about him is, you can’t say “George Osbourne is not a real Osbourne&#8221;. Even if you can, it won&#8217;t make a lot of sense, because an “Osbourne” is not a thing beyond the context of being a surname. So my useful template is useless here.</p>
<p>He does look a bit like a badger, such that even though his surname isn&#8217;t Badger, it would be helpful to remind people that he isn&#8217;t one. But there is another thing about him: “George Osbourne is not a real George.” By which I mean that his real name is Gideon George Oliver Osbourne.</p>
<p>&#8220;George&#8221; Osbourne is a liar. He&#8217;s been lying to us. Because when someone says their name, it&#8217;s expected in Western cultures that the first name is followed by the last name, and that&#8217;s that. Osbourne has not met those expectations. But it&#8217;s clear that he doesn&#8217;t like the &#8220;Gideon&#8221; name, so what&#8217;s a man to do?</p>
<p>I&#8217;ll tell you what a man&#8217;s to do. Moments ago, into my face fell a book that had been written by Somerset Maugham, who is someone who writes books. But it was not by “Somerset Maugham”; it was by “W Somerset Maugham”. From this fact, we can learn several other ones. We learn that Somerset is not his actual first name, that instead it’s one beginning with W (probably Walt, Willie or Wendy). But we also learn that, just like the chanceller of the exchequer, he prefers his middle name. And that&#8217;s fine, since he has the decency to include the first initial, which serves as a helpful indicator that there&#8217;s something else there. So why shouldn&#8217;t Osbourne do the same? Why not &#8220;G George Osbourne&#8221;?</p>
