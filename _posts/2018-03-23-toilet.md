What I learned on the web this week:

1. [Pissing Match: Is the World Ready for the Waterless Urinal?](https://www.wired.com/2010/06/ff_waterless_urinal/) (2011):

    > [James] Krug is an unusual entrepreneur. Twenty years ago, he was a rising star in the film and television business. [...] But 11 years ago, Krug became convinced that the world did not need another TV show. What it needed was a better urinal.

2.  [↬](https://twitter.com/GlennF/status/976595613147021313):

    > [Major [Seattle] City Hall Scoop](https://twitter.com/KromanDavid/status/976594541099667456): The flushless urinals are corroding the pipes and must be replaced with old fashion[ed] flushing urinals. Dudes: You need to hydrate more so your pee isn't so destructive.

    [Apparently this isn't a new problem.](http://www.greenbuildinglawblog.com/2010/02/articles/codes-1/stinky-situationsthe-corrosive-case-of-waterless-urinals/) Non-flushing urinals are fine if the pipes are made from materials other than copper, which resist corrosion better. But sometimes building regulations stipulate copper pipes. I'm not curious enough to find out what Seattle City Hall's pipes are made of. 

3. [China’s New Frontiers in Dystopian Tech](https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2018/04/big-in-china-machines-that-scan-your-face/554075/):

    > Dystopia starts with 23.6 inches [60 centimetres] of toilet paper. That’s how much the dispensers at the entrance of the public restrooms at Beijing’s Temple of Heaven dole out in a program involving facial-recognition scanners—part of the president’s “Toilet Revolution,” which seeks to modernize public toilets. Want more? Forget it. If you go back to the scanner before nine minutes are up, it will recognize you and issue this terse refusal: “Please try again later.”
