<p><a href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-1174271/Tories-deny-YouTube-video-shows-David-Cameron-1988-rave.html">From the <cite>Daily Mail</cite></a> (so be careful, that&#8217;s a link to the <cite>Daily Mail</cite> website):</p>
<blockquote><p>The Tories were today forced to deny that a video clip purporting to show a long-haired party-goer at a 1988 outdoor rave was the party leader David Cameron.</p></blockquote>
<p>Read that again. Now, that <em>David Cameron is a video clip</em> is a serious allegation.</p>
