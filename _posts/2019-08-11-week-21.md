This week, I have been mostly on holiday.
Not really off-grid, but when I saw the "30–50 feral hogs" phenomenon on Twitter I was confusedly wondering what it all meant for possibly longer than I would normally have been.

One highlight – surely the proudest moment – was screwing a cork onto a saucepan lid that had lost its handle.
There's never the right screw to hand – first I used one with too small a head, requiring me to fashion a makeshift washer from a piece of metal that had previously nestled against a different cork atop a bottle of sparkling wine, and then I replaced it with a screw whose head was just big enough, but which was needlessly long and had only a partial thread.

Another highlight was experiencing [the famous Carrefour Crackers Goût Pizza](https://cheeseburgercrisps.blogspot.com/2019/02/carrefour-crackers-gout-pizza.html). I wouldn't say they're really _goût pizza_ – they resemble cheese flavoured crackers, and while the topping does do a great job of making them look like tiny pizzas, it's almost entirely decorative. But they're fine.

I did _some_ work. Enthusiastic fellows have been editing vehicle details with great enthusiasm, and their edits sitting in the queue for too long would wrack me with guilt.

Good week.
