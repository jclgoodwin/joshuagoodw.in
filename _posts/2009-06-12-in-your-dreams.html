title: In your dreams
---

<p>I am in bed. I am asleep. And yet, quite incredibly, I’m doing all sorts of wonderful things. I am flying through the sky, with some other people. It’s rather groovy. Then we hit the ground with a nasty splat, and land in some sort of swamp on the outskirts of a frightfully middle-class Norfolk town – never knew such a thing existed there.</p>
<p>I am not as injured as the others. Their knees somehow appear to have been gnawed at like corn on the cob in the impact. I run off to find help and a telephone box, apparently not noticing the bright red shiny one which has been helpfully erected just beside the quagmire in which we landed.</p>
<p>I sort of get lost and end up pushing a half-eaten banana into a red post box. I waste time queuing to apologise to the ban behind the counter – it’s a sort of outdoor post office, rather like an ice-cream hatch, which is for some reason part of a small bus station. I apologise loudly, and am then peculiarly embarrassed when I notice that some people who I know have been within earshot of my gratuitous pleas for forgiveness from the postman.</p>
<p>Of course, it was all a dream &#8211; but a pretty cool one, right? I quite like the idea of posting a banana through the opening of a postbox – although that would never really happen. It could, I realise, be seen as symbolic &#8211; but it isn&#8217;t, I assure you.</p>
<p>Another dream I had. I am yet again in bed, asleep &#8211; this being a dream, yeah? &#8211; and this time walking about in my head. <a href="/2009/06/get-a-moob-on">Get a moob on</a> happens. I answer in a deep voice &#8220;I am a girl&#8221;. Or I answer in a shrill voice &#8220;I am a boy&#8221;. It is obvious that they are being idiotholes, and I am poking fun through the bars at them.</p>
<p>Maybe I strapped a giant papier mache sausage between my legs, for added irony. It could have been a real sausage, in fact, either raw or sizzled. Or a salami &#8211; one of those would&#8217;ve been better. Perhaps a parsnip, or a carrot (which is essentially a parsnip painted orange), or an aubergine would be more ethical &#8211; I wouldn&#8217;t want an innocent sausage dog (cos that&#8217;s what they make sausages out of, yeah?) to be slaughtered just for the purposes of my ridiculous jape.</p>
<p>It doesn&#8217;t matter about the accuracy of the details, because it will always be a great big pork pie. You see, that dream was never had. My dreams are always unpredictable post-modern surrealist things like the banana post box one. The didn’t even happen in real life. I wish I had done that – it would have been jolly fantabulous – but I didn’t.</p>
<p>Lots of regrets about how I handled that incident. I didn&#8217;t really take note of who those girls where, because I was so very bamboozled and shocked and that. I should have. This little round ball on which we live being so, well, little, it&#8217;s highly likely that our paths will cross again. And the alligator will be thinking, &#8220;oh, ha, this is the chap who I accused of having wobbly chest-mounted udders&#8221;, whilst I am none the wiser. It could have been anyone. At least I know that this person had no unusual features &#8211; a pair of enormous ears, for instance, cos I&#8217;d have noticed if they&#8217;d have been there, and I didn&#8217;t notice so they clearly weren&#8217;t there.</p>
<p>Mind you, I’m not completely rubbish at sudden on-the-spot funny improvisation. For instance, when asked for his views on footballer Mr Ronaldo&#8217;s £80,000,000 purchase by Real Madrid, my biology teacher simply said: &#8220;I&#8217;m sure it&#8217;s very nice for him.&#8221; Pathetic. I, on the other hand, made the sharp point that, with today&#8217;s exchange rate, £80,000,000 is probably worth only about £5. That&#8217;s all juicy and topical and I am a genius. It somehow produced a terrifying laugh which was probably a little fake but still&#8230;</p>
<p>I could, of course, have suggested that he needs the money to support his ice cream business. That would be like well clever. But, you readers don&#8217;t know what I&#8217;m talking about, because you haven&#8217;t come across <a href="http://www.ronaldo-ices.co.uk">Ronaldo Ices</a> of Norfolk. Still, doesn&#8217;t matter, because I&#8217;ve got a lot of other Ronaldo-based material. Like the exchange rate thing. And that&#8217;s all.</p>
