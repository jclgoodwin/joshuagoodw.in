Week notes are a thing I do now.
I have enjoyed reading [the week notes of a small number of strangers on the internet](https://adactio.com/journal/14955),
mostly published on their own [IndieWeb](https://indieweb.org/) sites, and why shouldn't I join in?

Last week, the process of reflection made me realise I'd managed to do a pleasing amount of work -- a valuable process.
This week, I appear to have done less -- which is healthy too. I have done some other things.

I took some photographs. They were better than last week's. Great!

I picked up some rubbish from off of the sides of some roads.
Like, I'm fond of saying, a pound shop [David Sedaris](https://www.theguardian.com/books/shortcuts/2014/jul/31/david-sedaris-litter-picker-rubbish-waste-vehicle-pig-pen-west-sussex), or [Ian McMillan](https://twitter.com/IMcMillan/status/1108256878428123137).
Those BBC radio stalwarts use special equipment -- "grabbers" -- but I'm not that serious yet.
I do recommend rubber gloves[^gloves], and a basket to which is attached a bicycle, and a plastic bag clipped on with clothes pegs.
Sunday was a particular purple patch: the strangest item for a few days (a Â¾ full box of croissants) dumped near a ford, and then I finally captured my white whale (a lager tin that had taunted me for weeks, embedded in a hedge) using a large twig.

It reminds me a bit of the postmodern [Stone Clearing With Richard Herring](https://www.comedy.co.uk/podcasts/stone_clearing_with_richard_herring/),
which is _not_ my cultural highlight of the week, but remains a podcast in the list of podcasts I listen to.
Gathering litter is only slightly more worthwhile than Herring's hobby of the ancient art of moving stones from a field to its perimeter.
Rampant capitalism and air pollution are more serious than fly-tipped food and drink packaging.

I wouldn't want anyone to think I've been encouraged by the <cite>Daily Mail</cite>--backed "Great British Spring Clean" campaign,
which is at least not as bad as 2016's ["Clean for The Queen"](https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2016/feb/29/clean-for-the-queen-keep-britain-tidy-michael-gove-boris-johnson) (ugh).

[^gloves]: Disappointingly, the Co-op's fairly traded rubber gloves are much worse than the Marigold brand.
