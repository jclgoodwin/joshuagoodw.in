- Thought to myself, “this is the first time I’ve been on a bicycle since I started doing the New York Times Spelling Bee regularly”.

- Thought to myself, it’s been a while since I saw a horse, or a cow.

- [bustimes.org](https://bustimes.org/#:~:text=Popular%20pages) now has a "popular pages" list.
  That's not short for "the 10 most popular pages in order of popularity"; it's a random 10 of the top 20, sorted by length (number-of-characters, not kilometres) for aesthetic reasons, you know like the [diamond geezer](https://diamondgeezer.blogspot.com/2026/01/woop-to-sl11.html) sidebar. It's absolutely not the best thing I could have done with the time, but it was mildly interesting, at the weekend, how the London bus routes SL11 (new) and 96 (change of operator) shot up there.

- They're digging up a bit of a road I sometimes walk along, so it's unusually quiet of traffic and stuff. Disquietingly, I still saw several people waiting for buses there – they hadn't read [the unclear and badly spelled](https://www.firstbus.co.uk/norfolk-suffolk/news-and-service-updates/updates/yarmouth-road-thorpe-st-andrew) post on the website equivalent of a disused lavatory with a sign on the door saying Beware of the Leopard. They might have scanned the QR code at the bus stop, but it wouldn't have helped cos no one had remembered to update the scrolly yellow bit of [the slightly cursed live departure board website](https://www.norfolkbus.info/ldb/stops/2900T1368).
  It's at least partly Elon Musk's fault, cos in the past this sort of thing would have been tweeted, but ¯\\\_(ツ)\_/¯.

  This left me fizzing with ideas about what I can do about it on bustimes.org, but ultimately you can't beat the helpful sheet of paper that one local person had taped to a bus shelter.

- 🎦 <i>Marty Supreme</i> is in fact not about Marti Pellow.
