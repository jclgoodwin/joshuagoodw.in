- I'm lazy about putting away clean dry laundry, never reaching [laundry zero](https://threebeansalad.wiki/en/episodes/season-19/Laundry). Maybe there's a solution that's like the laundry equivalent of Ben Fogle's <del>two</del> four dishwasher machines: having enough clothes horses to hold all your clean clothes, instead of a wardrobe. Or I could persuade myself to be less lazy: consider that the robotics companies have yet to produce a robot that can fold clothes well, so that's one of my few advantages over robots, and I should celebrate that by putting my skills to use. And it's a good way to pad your step count – even if you aren't walking, a smartwatch is fooled by the arm movements involved.

  - [Limmy had some good advice](https://brianlimond.substack.com/p/clothes-horse-advice) about where to hang what on a clothes horse.

   - I've seen the advertising executive–turned–unlikely TikTok star Rory Sutherland described as "the two dishwashers guy", on account of a viral clip of [him talking about the idea](https://behavioralscientist.org/is-everything-bs/#:~:text=you%20should%20get-,two%20dishwashers,-%2C%20nearly%20everybody%2C%20either), but please let's not erase Ben and Marina Fogle.

- If using AI is like eating animal products, then I fear I've become like a vegan who eats prawns, but it's boring to talk about.
