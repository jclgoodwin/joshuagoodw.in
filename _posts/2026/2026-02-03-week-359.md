- The road closure (see last week) got extended. I wish I didn't care that they've misspelt buses this time.

  My fizzing-with-ideas hasn't translated into me doing any work about it, but it might be time for me to learn what a Web Component is.

- The Orielles (h).

- To London, by FlixBus. I was impressed that there were two drivers, yes they appeared to be double crewing it, but I should have realised more quickly that this was foreshadowing being delayed by a gloop of slow-moving traffic. Oh well, I can't deny that it was £6.49. I felt sorrier for the rainswept folks waiting for the return journey, although the double crewing meant they wouldn't need to wait for the driver's legally require break like [I did that time](/2025/04/week-319).

- Snapped a key in a lock of a door, which could have been a chance to use my [extraction tool](/2022/08/week-180) again at last, if only it wasn't a hundred miles away. But I had access to tweezers – no good – and nail clippers – good – so it was only maybe ten minutes of stressful panic.

- Having an afternoon to spare, I went to the Croydon Ikea in search of the [32 cm plate](/2025/11/week-347#:~:text=massive%20Flamsig%2032%20cm%20plate). The website said they were in stock there, and not in any other easier-to-get-to London Ikeas, but I couldn't find any 32 cm plates. (The next day the website said they were out of stock.) To save face I bought two normal-sized plates instead. Couldn't be arsed to queue for meatballs.
