What happened this week?

I did some work. Sorry if this is overly technical, but I’m changing some stuff to make it less shit, which feels like a rather big and grand job. It’s necessary to force myself not to make it too much better in one go, so that I can replace the old shit with the new shit more gradually. If I get ahead of myself, it could become too much like _replacing the engines of an aeroplane in midflight_. (It’s nothing like that. It’s just a website.)

Some bicycling around. Took some poor photographs of buses, which were made up for by ￼the chance to record [some benches](https://openbenches.org),  and the pleasantness of bicycling around. Today it has rained prolongedly, and roads have flooded in several places, and what fun it was to splash through puddles ten or so centimetres deep. I saw [some ducks](https://www.instagram.com/p/B3SHKPkHQ58/)

I’ve been watching <cite>The Simpsons</cite>, which is terrific fun. The first three series, which I guess were the start of the golden age, are on the likes of iTunes. When Walter Disney’s streaming service launches, apparently it will have every episode ever, so maybe I’ll be persuaded to pay Walter Disney some money for that. (Also this week, I enjoyed [this bit of Winnie-the-Pooh](https://twitter.com/JoseMLuna/status/1180152331708456961), but amazing as it is I’m not sure one would want to sit through a whole film or programme.)

Stewart Lee appeared [on the Book Shambles podcast](https://cosmicshambles.com/bookshambles/stewart-lee-returns-again), which is my cultural highlight of the week. They mention the William Blake exhibition, which constitutes a helpful reminder to go and see it (we have until the start of February).
