- As a change from looking at the comments on newspaper websites,
  I looked at a forum where some angry presumably men were arguing about surround sound.
  And how comforting it is to see an argument about something that actually doesn't matter.

- Down another rabbit hole, I came across <cite>The Forme of Cury</cite>.
  Isn't written Middle English funny, ha ha.

  You know, I think someone from a free market thinktank cooked and tweeted a picture of that the other day.

- I felt a bit poorly, but only for a day â€“ what an impressive recovery.

- Someone had daubed one of the most profane profanities, and some anatomically incorrect genitalia, on the frontage of a fishmongery.
  I guess the perp doesn't like fish, fair enough, but the quality of the graffito was shockingly poor.
  (Actually, on closer examination of the photo I took, which I'm happy to share with anyone who emails in, I can see that I was a bit harsh.)
