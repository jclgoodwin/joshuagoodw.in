What happened this week?

I did some work. Had another little outage which was my fault again.
Made some maps fall less easily to hand – because maps are fiddly to scroll past and consume mobile data allowances and all that, it's an improvement for people not interested in maps, and so few map fans have complained that I think it was the right thing to do.

The "get ready for [breakfast]" public information campaign has started.
I filled in the government's download tool setup wizard--style[^1] questionnaire, and it made me start to question what words even mean and things:

- Various questions where "UK" and "EU" are mutually exclusive options.
  Anyone who's [dealt with VAT recently](https://www.revk.uk/2018/11/making-tax-digital.html) will probably have made peace with this wording by now – of course they mean "the rest of the EU".

- "Do you plan to travel after 31 October 2019?"

- "Are you preparing a business or organisation for [breakfast]?"
  What if the truthful the answer is no, but only because you've been procrastinating?

I enjoyed [<cite>Uncle</cite>](https://www.comedy.co.uk/tv/uncle/).
Then I started [<cite>Spy</cite>](https://www.comedy.co.uk/tv/spy/), whose first episode was some jolly fun but it seems to get worse from there.
