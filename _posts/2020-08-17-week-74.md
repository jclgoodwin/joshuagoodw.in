- I don't know if you've noticed how the amount of shit gets more and more with every day. But think how we'll be looking back at now with nostalgia in a few months!

- In a fit of pique, I discarded the sourdough starter and made a wonderful boring loaf in a tin using some instant dried yeast I'd had all this time, bought casually back when it was supposed to be difficult to buy yeast. It was a delight, a great bulging thing, just the right size and shape to fit in the toaster, and untainted by lactic acid.

  Now, maybe discarding the levain was a bit silly, not because there's any value in it being old – it's a Trigger's broom (ship of Theseus) situation – but because it's a waste of a bit of flour and water. Oh well.

- Some work. Fixed some embarrassing errors. Ugh.

- Went to some not very faraway places and saw some things. Got rained on, which is at least different to sweating.

In conclusion, another week in the history of weeks.
