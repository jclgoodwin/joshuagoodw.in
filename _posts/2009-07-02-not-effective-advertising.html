title: Not effective advertising
---

<p>Something on my mind these days is advertising. I&#8217;m keen to get the word about this blog spread about as much as possible, you see &#8211; it would be selfish not to &#8211; and I have been keeping my eyes peeled for examples of advertising.</p>
<p>Here is a tasty morsel of advertising that I want to talk about. It&#8217;s a billboard advertising a product called &#8220;Tango&#8221;, which is some kind of fizzy, sugary, orangey beverage which I have consumed on two occasions.</p>
<p><img src="/images/69.jpg" title="Too much Tango made me suck a bull's udder" alt="Too much Tango made me suck a bull's udder" /></p>
<p>The advertisement tells the tragic story of a person who drank too much Tango, and was then compelled to suck the udder of a bull.</p>
<p>Naturally, the makers of Tango want us to drink as much Tango as possible. So why are they warning us that there might be these dangerous side-effects?</p>
<p>If such side-effects exist, then it&#8217;s obviously a legal requirement to stuck some small lettering at the bottom. But the thing is, there is no evidence whatsoever, as far as I am aware, to suggest that consuming too much Tango can do anything other than destroy your teeth. They are presumably trying to sound dangerous and edgy, like drugs or something, but instead it&#8217;s off-putting.</p>
<p>Although I live in the countryside, there are not many bulls nearby. In order to suck a bull&#8217;s udder, I would have to run for miles, squandering time that could be otherwise used much more effectively &#8211; I could be busy not writing a blog post, for instance.</p>
<p>And bulls don&#8217;t even have udders. I&#8217;m sure there&#8217;s some kind of law against that &#8211; suggesting that bulls have udders, when in fact they don&#8217;t. It&#8217;s misleading. A bull would no doubt grow extremely horny and furious if one started looking for an udder about its person on which to suck.</p>
<p>I am never going to drink Tango again. Sucking a bull&#8217;s udder sounds nightmarish.</p>
<p>Unless maybe this is a cunning plot from the makers of a rival fizzy drink, such as Dr Pepper (who, I believe is not an actual qualified doctor &#8211; a bit like Gillian McKeith). In that case, it&#8217;s very clever indeed. There will, I assume, be a follow-up &#8211; &#8220;Too much Dr Pepper made my goldfish immortal&#8221;, or something else equally enticing.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m thinking of a similar plot. &#8220;Reading TechCrunch turns your eyeballs into corks.&#8221;</p>
