title: Oh, the humanity
---

<p>It seems to me that if you want to use a humane markup language, you have mostly got two options: <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Textile_%28markup_language%29">Textile</a> and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markdown">Markdown</a>.</p>
<p>Actually, no, there&#8217;s a lot of things wrong with that. Like, Wikipedia calls them <em>lighweight</em> markup languages &#8211; &#8220;humane&#8221; is just what Textile calls itself, but I wanted to have a goodish headline for this. And there&#8217;s <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lightweight_markup_language">a lot of different ones</a>, even discounting those with different priorities. But <a href="http://5by5.tv/b2w/25" title="Back to Work #25: My Food Court of Functionality">Markdown gets</a> all the girls these days, and any left over go to Textile.</p>
<p>Markdown or Textile. Textile or Markdown. But which is better, Markdown or Textile? There&#8217;s only one way to find out.</p>
<p>Markdown can do this:</p>
<blockquote>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Bacon ipsum dolor sit amet meatball in elit irure, officia ex swine ad pastrami tempor et. Ullamco pork belly hamburger, exercitation eu occaecat tri-tip brisket irure laboris pork loin elit:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Aute chuck tri-tip, short ribs occaecat turkey do drumstick corned beef shank rump in ribeye fatback anim. Quis t-bone short ribs officia, shankle pig swine cillum meatloaf esse. Tongue sirloin pork tri-tip, veniam sint pariatur esse proident t-bone pork belly. </p>
</blockquote>
<p>Shank short ribs sint, labore meatloaf beef aute incididunt non shankle consequat tri-tip officia. Velit meatloaf andouille pork chop.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>&#8220;A real leader of men neither acts like a spoilt child or a yobbo,&#8221; columnises columnist Jon Gaunt in his <cite>Sun</cite> column. (He&#8217;s arguing that John Terry isn&#8217;t a real leader of men.)</p>
<p>This would be stylistically more elegant: &#8220;A real leader of men acts like neither a spoilt child nor a yobbo.&#8221; In your face, Rupert Murdoch.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</blockquote>
<p>Isn&#8217;t that beautiful? It&#8217;s some list items, and each list item contains some paragraphs. (To really rub it in, I added a <code>blockquote</code> to the mix.) Textile can&#8217;t do that, unless you break down and write the raw HTML yourself. Is that a problem? I don&#8217;t know, but I use that feature <a href="/2011/07/wizard">all</a> <a href="/2010/11/nomenclature">the</a> <a href="/2011/02/dont-have-nightmares">time</a>.</p>
<p>On the other hand, Textile can do this:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Hello, holoalphabetic sentences:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Jackdaws love my big sphinx of quartz.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>El veloz murciélago hindú comía feliz cardillo y kiwi. La cigüeña tocaba el saxofón detrás del palenque de paja.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Portez ce vieux whisky au juge blond qui fume.</p>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p>By that, I don&#8217;t mean that Textile supports blockquotes within blockquotes, because it doesn&#8217;t &#8211; I mean that it&#8217;s possible to have multiple consecutive blockquotes next to each other. Markdown is so giddy about having multiple paragraphs together in the same wrapper that it <a href="http://six.pairlist.net/pipermail/markdown-discuss/2006-October/000329.html">merges the blockquotes you always dreamed of</a>.</p>
<p>(Early versions of Textile actually lacked support for the super-blockquote that contains more than one paragraph. Now, there is the better of both worlds.)</p>
<p>There are other things. Textile&#8217;s link syntax can be fragile, but Markdown doesn&#8217;t do tables. Swings and roundabouts, Gary.</p>
<h3>Fragmentation</h3>
<p>There is a <a href="http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/dingus">Markdown dingus</a>. It is <em>the</em> Markdown dingus. You can type things in and test things out. What better word for it?</p>
<p>For Textile, there are too many dinguses. Textism hosts a <a href="http://www.textism.com/tools/textile/">very outdated one</a>. A more modern dingus <a href="http://textile.thresholdstate.com/">exists elsewhere</a>, but even that still talks about version 2.0. The version <a href="http://textpattern.googlecode.com/svn/development/4.x/textpattern/lib/classTextile.php">packaged with Textpattern</a> is 2.2. Get with the program.</p>
<p>As for me, I use Markdown now. It is good. But sometimes I lapse into raw HTML, and it&#8217;s a frightening warning of what once was.</p>
