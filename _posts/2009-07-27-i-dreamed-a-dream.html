title: I dreamed a dream
---

<p>Susannah Boil dreamed a dream, didn&#8217;t she? And everyone was terribly amazed, because, bite my hinges, it wasn&#8217;t terrible despite her hirsuteness. (Really, I&#8217;d expect hair to absorb the sound and improve the acoustics, like carpets and curtains do.) That&#8217;s how I remember it, anyhow, although I was rather busy frothing with rage at the fact that Piers Morgan is allowed to be a member of Society and not be pelted with corks. Of course, this is a very topical topic right now, and <em>nobody</em> has ever pointed it out before.</p>
<p>Interestingly, I have not watched the video. Maybe nobody has, and it&#8217;s all a big conspiracy theorem. A bit like the moon landings, but actually true. No, that doesn&#8217;t work. That&#8217;s a rubbish idea. Sorry.</p>
<p>A nice way to do over 100 words,all that, but nothing to do with anything that I am trying to point out here. Apart from the word &#8220;dream&#8221;. Because I have a strange desire to tell you about a dream I had. <a href="/in-your-dreams">Yeah, <em>again</em>.</a></p>
<p>It seems a sensible thing to do. Why not? Everyone has dreams, so everyone can <em>relate</em> to it, you know? Besides, judging by Boil&#8217;s success, it might increase <a href="http://www.youtube.com/user/goodwinified">my YouTube numbers</a> &#8211; obviously I don&#8217;t care about such pathetically shallow things, but I&#8217;m so fantastic at what I do that the world deserves to know about it.</p>
<p>I notice that there is <a href="http://www.dreammoods.com/">a website</a> that, like, lets you <em>interpret</em> your dreams and shit. I&#8217;ll let the website explain for itself, with this helpful blockquote.</p>
<blockquote>

We&#8217;re dedicated to helping you find the key to unlocking and interpreting the meanings to your dreams. By understanding your dreams, you will gain a better perspective on your life. </p>

<p>It&#8217;s a bit useless website. If I am feeling, say, <em>thirsty</em><sup class="footnote"><a href="#fn9767741384aafedfae243b">1</a></sup>, I don&#8217;t need to look on a website to tell me that I am experiencing that emotion. I am concious enough to be able to tell that that&#8217;s the emotion who is tickling my armpits today, and I can sort of guess that the dream I had about salty mangoes<sup class="footnote"><a href="#fn4631993054aafedfae2821">2</a></sup> was connected to this emotion.</p>
<p>So. The dream. I appear to be piling boxes of charcoal and firelighters onto a crate. Then I am standing behind a counter. The queen arrives &#8211; sporting a controversial new hairstyle that everyone tuts about &#8211; and I am so surprised by this famous celebrity&#8217;s shock unexpected appearance that I do not curtsey. So she walks backwards and then forwards again, like a sizzling Betamax cassette, to give me a second attempt.</p>
<p>I do not for one moment do the sensible thing and point out that the monarchy is a ridiculous idea that should have stopped when we invented plastic corks (well, it is), and that this old lady who is here to collect a piece of laminated cardboard should be treated just like any other lady who is here to collect a piece of laminated cardboard.</p>
<p>I certainly do not point out that laminating cardboard is not very environmentally friendly. But I should have. I will do that next time. We can&#8217;t have them people who live in my head laminating laminations or whatever. Rubber.</p>
<p>I would tell you more but I have run out of time. This was a bad idea. Laters.</p>
