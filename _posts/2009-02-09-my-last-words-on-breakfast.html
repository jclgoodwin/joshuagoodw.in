title: My last words on breakfast
---

<p>This thing I&#8217;m doing, this thing where I try to write a blog post article thing every day this month, is good. But it&#8217;s not without its flaws.</p>
<p>You see, I&#8217;m always in such a sweaty rush to quickly send a blog post spinning through cyberspace, spurred on by a fear of being subjected to the torturous public humiliation that is being force-fed socks. And this sickening hurriedness means that I often hit <em>Publish</em> before I&#8217;ve really said all I want to.</p>
<p>My two articles on breakfast have proved phenomenally successful. But thanks to my aforementioned eagerness to get the stuff out in as much of a jiffy as possible, I&#8217;ve still got plenty piping-hot issues on my chest, which I would quite like to get off my chest because the piping-hot nature of them is scorching my nipples rather horribly.</p>
<p>So, that&#8217;s what I&#8217;m doing right here, right now. Getting some final breakfast-related issues off my chest, so that I can go on to live the rest of my life happily in the knowledge that I&#8217;ve said all there is to be said.</p>
<p>I&#8217;d better get started, then. Time to make a few more important remarks on that most pressing of issues, <a href="/2009/02/cereal">breakfast cereal</a>.</p>
<p>On Saturday, I found myself with a wealth of breakfast cereal possibilities. I could eat either Bran Flakes or <a href="http://www.tesco.com/superstore/xpi/3/xpi54909583.htm">Malt Wheats</a>, and I chose Malt Wheats. I then had the option of drizzling some raspberry coulis on the Wheats, which I opted for. Then I drizzled on some semi-skimmed right &#8211; that&#8217;s right, <em>semi</em>-skimmed! &#8211; milk, and then I decided to sprinkle on some drinking chocolate.</p>
<p>Yuck.</p>
<p>I manged two mouthfuls, before tipping the lot in the bin and just eating a croissant.</p>
<p>Suffice to say, I just had some plain Malt Wheats with milk the next day. Never again will I dare indulge in such gratuitous and nauseating frippery as drinking chocolate powder and raspberry coulis.</p>
<p>Also, on the issue of milk, what&#8217;s up with filtered milk? <em>Filtered milk</em>. It&#8217;s just such a stupid, stupid idea. Apparently, it stays fresh for longer, because they do something to it and keep it in a special bottle that is too close to opaque for one to be able to easily discern how much milk is left.</p>
<p>The only other thing I can think of about cereal is that sometimes fruit is nice.</p>
<p>OK then, onto toast. I have more to say about his one. I didn&#8217;t even get to mention the sodding marmalade <a href="/2009/02/the-obligatory-toast-post">yesterday</a>. <em>That&#8217;s</em> how serious this is.</p>
<p>I am quite fussy about marmalade. I am a Frank Cooper&#8217;s Vintage Oxford Marmalade man. Anything else &#8211; even Frank Cooper&#8217;s Original Oxford Marmalade &#8211; is disgusting, and I think it resembles the poo of the Beelzebub, when said thing has been eating Australian bacon.</p>
<p>My mother is making marmalade today, incredibly. The pan is massive. I look forward to it. I will mention it here when I&#8217;ve had the opportunity to get my chops around some.</p>
<p>Jam is good. Honey is good, although it mustn&#8217;t bee (happy accident typo there!) too runny or too hard, and I&#8217;m not sure what I&#8217;ll do when the bees all die as they&#8217;re supposedly doing.</p>
<p>Marmite&#8230; well, I am starting to get into that particular condiment. You must be modest with your spreading, though. My great uncle is famed for his mountainous helpings of butter and honey, and I suspect his experiences with the yeast extract have been unhappy ones. Those Marmite jars are ludicrously tiny for a reason, you know.</p>
<p>Sometimes I eat a crumpet, although I find that they generally collapse under the pressure of the Marmite. They are jolly feeble.</p>
<p>Croissants are good. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pain_au_chocolat"><em>Pain au chocolat</em></a>, though, is <em>miles</em> better.</p>
<p>Phew. All that should satisfy my cravings for writing about breakfast. For a few weeks. Maybe. This was another rushed article, and my legs are shaking like you couldn&#8217;t imagine, but at least I have ensured that socks will not be on the menu tomorrow morning.</p>
