- A bit of work. Lots to do – I could tell myself I'm deliberately being restrained, saving it up for all the further weeks of this lockdown, but that's a bit stupid.

- Some things I forgot to mention in previous weeks:

  - I approve of [Helen Zaltzman's advice for working from home](https://helenzaltzman.wordpress.com/2020/03/19/wfh/).

  - [A Twitter thread about the origin of the name of the food product "Triscuit"](https://twitter.com/sageboggs/status/1242968530250870786) got some attention. As if to annoy me as precisely as possible, it even began with the phrase "buckle up". The author says he did some "sleuthing" and "stumbled upon" evidence that led him uncover the truth, which smells disingenuous because [the snack crackers' Wikipedia page](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Triscuit) has for some years held some clues. Maybe I'm taking this too seriously, and poetic licence applies.

- More <cite>Spooks</cite>. Another thing I forgot to mention last week: the woman from the BT adverts inexplicably has a picture of a pig:

  Well, maybe explicably – it's an excellent pig, an absolute unit, no explanation needed.

  Now, some series and deaths and disappearances of main characters later, Martine McCutcheon – from some yoghurt adverts, and who is famously rhyming slang for "escutcheon" – has appeared, and well done to her.

- I enjoyed [James Acaster's "Quarantunes" playlist](https://open.spotify.com/playlist/6PQLNIY9wZFZAygGzgH5hc), particularly as my Spotify "discover weakly" playlist has been being rubbish.

Happy new tax year.
