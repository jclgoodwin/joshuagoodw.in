title: Oh look, some air
---

<p>I was hoping, readers, to today continue that <a href="/present-tense">ripping thriller of a tale from yesterday</a>. But I got a bit distracted, and before I knew it I was feeding those eleven brutish children of my impertinent butler with some stale smoked salmon. Never let it be said that I don&#8217;t have a philanthropic bone in my body &#8211; my whole skeleton is dripping with pure philanthropy, I&#8217;ll have you know.</p>
<p>So here&#8217;s a sunset. <a href="/scenes-from-a-walk">Another one.</a></p>

<p>I almost dropped the camera doing that, I&#8217;ll have you know. Although you probably won&#8217;t have appreciated those snaps.</p>
<p>Those bones of my body which are not philanthropic  are decked out with intellectual insecurity. Hence this quote, from off of <a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/dp/1405200715/?tag=joshgood-21">a book that I read once</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&#8220;Shh,&#8221; Hector said. &#8220;Who cares about the sunset? Just watch the crows.&#8221;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Also, I found myself watching come chidren&#8217;s television yesterday. It was, I imagine, not dissimilar to what happens after consuming an excessive quantity of Beechams.</p>
