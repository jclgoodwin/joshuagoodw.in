<p>This video of <a href="http://joekraus.com/were-creating-a-culture-of-distraction">this talk</a> from Joe Kraus, &#8220;Weâ€™re creating a culture of distraction&#8221;, may be worth 15 minutes of your time.</p>

<p>Well done to Matt Mullenweg for <a href="http://ma.tt/2012/05/culture-of-distraction/">pointing us towards</a> it. He goes on to point out some further reading there,  which I certainly intend to investigate, and so maybe should you.</p>
<hr />
<p>I shall now distract you by pointing out Ze Frank&#8217;s <a href="http://ashow.zefrank.com/"><cite>A Show</cite></a>, which is the thing that he is doing; as for him, well, he&#8217;s a person that one is expected to have heard of, and it appears deservedly so.</p>
<p><cite>A Show</cite> shows every sign of being quite good. After watching the widely publicised first episode whenever it appeared, I began to take his faintly drab blog, expecting that I would henceforth be informed of each show as it came. But no, of course there&#8217;s none of that hyperactive self-promotion there, which actually is rather classy once you get used to it. The only result is a large backlog of maybe 20 glistening unwatched turds, which I found there waiting for me, and I find that rather wonderful.</p>
