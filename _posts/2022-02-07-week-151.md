- Got [some rubber feet](https://shop.electrolux.co.uk/laundry/washing-machines/feet-housing/washing-machine-rubber-foot-kit/p/4055126249) to stop the washer-dryer making such an earthquakey racket when spinning at full revs.
  Bit surprised that only two feet arrived, cos obviously it’s a four-legged cuboidal washer-dryer, but two were enough.
  They go on the front legs, and I didn’t need to adjust the back legs to make the machine level (so it must have hitherto been leaning a bit forwards).
  And lo, the rubber feet do a good job of dampening the vibrations, a better job than the scraps of cloth the last people here had tried to use.

  Also some cleaning/descaling powder that I hoped would make the rubber seal around the door less disgusting.
  I ran a hot wash with some powder (no clothes) in the drum, as instructed, and ... I don't think it's had much effect.

- To the cinema. 
  <cite>Liquorice Pizza</cite> is good in parts.
  Like those Amazon customer reviews of important works of literature that focus on the packaging and speed of delivery,
  I’ll mention that the heating was broken, which spared us the usual hassle of removing coats and gloves and reduced the risk of nodding off. 

- Some fun perambulations on and off the bicycle, including a pointless squelch around some of the south bank of the Yare where I wheeled the bike along and great clods of mud gathered on the tyres to such an extent that the mudguards sort of burst – so that's why [a proper person picks up and carries the bike on their shoulders](https://www.alamy.com/stock-photo-man-hiking-with-mountain-bike-over-shoulder-35711301.html).

  After everything, popped the bike in the bath (with a strainer deployed to stop debris blocking the drain) and followed the lead of the [Global Cycling Network chap](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lE2eGfGrclA). But maybe next time I'll use the jet wash at the petrol station. Relatedly, [the magic eraser](https://www.bmstores.co.uk/products/elbow-grease-magic-eraser-3pk-375598) is excellent at removing a muddy smear from a wall, if you can contain your pedantic indignance at the "no need for chemicals, just add water" claim (water is a chemical!)

- You don't need to hear my cool story about the self-checkout machine at Morrisons.
  Needless to say, everyone's so used to dismissing the "Card payments only, no cash payments" pop-up that no-one notices if it actually says "Card payments only? No, cash payments."
