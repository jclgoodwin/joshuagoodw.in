title: Beachbumdog billionaire

<p>Hello. Me here, you&#8217;ll be pleased to know. I haven&#8217;t changed my name or been hijacked, although if I did change my name it would be cool to go by the groovy moniker &#8220;Cornelius&#8221;.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m in a local market town, in my grandmother&#8217;s house, feverishly tapping away at a beige keyboard. </p>
<p>Yesterday evening&#8217;s Thai meal was a delight. Maybe a review will follow. Or maybe not. I did remember the name of one more restaurant reviewer, at least &#8211; Jay Rayner, who I believe looks a bit like some sort of seal or sea monster or something.</p>

<p>We&#8217;ve been to the beach, hence the title of this post &#8211; and the picture above, which would be rather cool and ironic and amusing if there was a fire in the foreground. I could superimpose it, I guess. If I cared, I would have gone to the trouble of burning something at the beach, to create the perfect scene, but I don&#8217;t care apparently.</p>
<p>My eyes are square &#8211; not literally, they&#8217;re still strictly speaking eliptical (I think) &#8211; from watching <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slumdog_Millionaire"><cite>Slumdog Millionaire</cite></a>, which is the feel-good film of the decade. You probably guessed this, also thanks to the title.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s not the feel-good film of the decade. I haven&#8217;t watched every film this decade &#8211; no-one has, in fact, for this decade is still slightly young &#8211; but I would be amazed to learn that no other film is more &#8220;feel-good&#8221;.</p>
<p>I mean, what&#8217;s so feel-good about having your eyes destroyed by a scary man who looks like Michael Jackson? What&#8217;s so feel-good about running about covered in what appears to be peanut butter, but is supposedly in fact fermenting poo? What&#8217;s so feel-good about being tortured by an angry policeman with (according to my grandmother) poor diction? I could go on, but I won&#8217;t because I&#8217;ve got to hurriedly finish this article.</p>
<p>There were confusing moments. Why was there a curly-haired man in a bath full of banknotes, for instance? But if one ignored the confusion, and flashbacks, and other stuff, and focused on the comprehensible bits, one enjoyed it.</p>
<p>The film is about a chap who wins <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Who_Wants_to_Be_a_Millionaire%3F"><cite>Who Wants to Be a Millionaire?</cite></a>. It&#8217;s sponsored by the people who make that programme, which means that everyone in the film is disproportionately obsessed by it. The only person who isn&#8217;t is a nasty man who is not satisfied with his jam sandwich, and furiously switches over to the cricket.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve always thought the <cite>Who Wants to Be a Millionaire?</cite> music, so very dramatic, deserved to feature in a film, and I was right. The music is all very brilliant, in fact. Well done, musician.</p>
<p>It was a bit like watching a normal episode of <cite>Who Wants to Be a Millionaire?</cite>, in some ways. Only, instead of the usual fish-scented impotent Chris Tarrant, perched on a stool and twiddling his hands, there was a bloke who looks a bit like that bloke in <cite>EastEnders</cite>. Every five seconds, the fun was interrupted by something resembling a Sudafed advert &#8211; just like in the TV gameshow.</p>
<p>One really annoying, goat-getting, gear-grinding thing is that the camera was often wonky. This was deliberate, I think, although the cameramen may have had dodgy tripods. (Of course, the ironic thing is that the picture above, which I took today, is also wonky.)</p>
<p>So, yeah, it&#8217;s a good film. I liked it. It&#8217;s probably saved me from a sock-eating sticky end, for now.</p>
