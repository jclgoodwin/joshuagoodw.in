<p>(Here&#8217;s an incidental thing: I just spent at least half an hour trying to pass parameters to the Vimeo oEmbed embed machine. I suppose I wanted to make the player more, uh, minimal. Well, it turns out that <a href="http://vimeo.com/plus">Vimeo Plus</a> members can prevent people from customising some aspects of their embeds, and evidently Merlin has chosen to do that. Which is fine, but is there a parable in there?)</p>
