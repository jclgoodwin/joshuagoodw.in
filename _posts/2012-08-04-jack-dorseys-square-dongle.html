title: Jack Dorsey&#8217;s Square dongle
---

<blockquote><p>Square may be best known for its dongle, but Dorsey says thatâ€™s just the beginning.</p></blockquote>
<p><a href="http://www.wired.com/business/2012/06/ff_dorsey/all/">An interesting thing with Dorsey</a> in one of the publications, written by Steven Levy, whose name sounds like one of the asinine &#8220;turns out&#8221; Malcwell Glandstone men, but in fact you&#8217;re thinking of someone else. Dorsey is just the person you&#8217;d expect to have invented the internet site Twitter, and that&#8217;s good because he did. But he&#8217;s also doing lots of stuff now. The most prolific man in what some people call &#8220;Silicone Valley&#8221;, which is a rather charming malopropism because it makes them sound like they just make rubbery sprockets and cookware. </p>
<p>I have recklessly ordered the <a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/dp/0981484603/?tag=joshgood-21"><cite>Wabi-Sabi</cite></a> book, an all retro one &#8220;printed&#8221; on some of that &#8220;paper&#8221;, from my favourite free-range artisanal bookseller. Called &#8220;Amazon&#8221;, which is like an omelette in South America, and also a river and a copse of thickets, so it must be authentic.</p>
<p>No, he seems like a cool guy.</p>
