- Stopped coughing in time for the festivities. Covonia Chesty Cough Mixture (Non Drowsy) is one hell of a drug, but also deploying goblin mode for two days helped.

- There's a rich vein of tweets etc saying [baby Jesus was the original nepo baby](https://twitter.com/search?q=jesus%20original%20nepo%20baby), but think for a moment, what about King Herod? Herod’s father wasn’t a king, but it seems likely his friendship with Julius Caesar got his son the job, and that has the stink of the old boy network.

- Did all my shopping on Christmas Eve, and it was quiet, so I recommend that, and I hope all the smug organised people who spent the preceding weeks queuing and elbowing their way through the crowds now feel silly.

- All the buzz about how great <cite>The White Lotus</cite> is was slightly annoying, but you know, they have a point. A thoughtless internet poster slightly spoilt the ending of the second serie, but really spoiling things isn't a thing. 

Have a nice week. I might get a new ice cube tray.
