- It’s really quite warm. But one bit of almost-fun is the challenge of walking somewhere via the shadiest route. There’s probably an app for it. Trees help, but even the most horrible paved piazza, in the shadow of an oppressive building, is suddenly one of the best places to be.

- The race to 10 Downing Street … the runners and riders … not clear who’s riding who or who’s being taken for a ride, but anyway, I enjoy every single tweet to the effect of “worst Kraftwerk concert ever” during the televised debates where the shits stand behind lecterns, thank you for your service. 

- 🎦 <cite>Octopussy</cite>. I had some problems with it, and it got worse as it went on, but it was some fun.
  The cinema was a bit too chilly, if anything; bring a blanket next time.

- A few episodes into <cite>The Outlaws</cite>. There’s a bit where someone says “the feds” but the subtitles say “the filth”. Anyway, it feels clearer than ever that was Merchant was responsible for the best bits of the things Gervais shared some of the credit for.

- My ma was fond of the (I think) phrasal verb “to fiddly-fart-arse”, as in “fiddly-fart-arsing while Rome burns.” Never heard anyone else say it. So I checked, and people do sometimes “fiddle _and_ fart-arse” but never fiddl<em>y</em>. Huh.
