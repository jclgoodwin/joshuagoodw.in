- Some little work. Now you can toggle between, for example, an [X21 timetable](https://bustimes.org/services/x21-birmingham-woodcock-hill-via-weoley-castle) and a combined X21 and X22 timetable.

- The mutiny about [the supposed-but-not-actual removal](https://www.theguardian.com/media/2022/nov/05/celebrations-scores-pr-hit-with-outrage-over-bounty-bars-that-arent-being-removed) of the Bounty chocolate bar from the Celebrations tub,
  an ingenious little publicity stunt.
  It's right that when all the real news is as it's always been â€“ everything, you know, fascism, all the ways in which we're doomed, etc. â€“ we go wild for a concocted thing about confectionery. But here's the thing â€“ and this is me at my most out-of-touch â€“ I'm not sure I've ever even eaten one of the sweets in question, low-cocoa-percentage shit, so I can't have an opinion.

- Cycled to Ipswich because of the railway strike and stuff. Stayed at Lenny Henry's house (the Premier Inn), reputedly the better of the three main hotel chains, and, you know, it might be? The shower was weak but there was a good supply of teabags and a complimentary chocolate orange which I didn't touch. To my surprise and delight it overlooked the local bus depot with its famously low roof.

  To Harry Hill's <cite>Pedigree Fun</cite>. Arrived late and missed the start â€“ I'd heard that the image of the radio phone-in legend [Nigel from Maidstone](https://youtu.be/p1SZlKWYAAQ?t=14), of all people, appears in an introductory video, but I can't confirm. Never mind, it was a special fun time.

  Cycled from Ipswich, quite rain-lashed. Apparently the roads of Suffolk have particularly bad drainage.
