- To Birmingham last weekend, arguably one of the country's ten or so main cities. There and back on the Megabus, which inspired me to make a few more [maps follow the roads](https://bustimes.org/services/m37-birmingham-norwich-city-centre#map), and I've a new idea for doing that for even more where currently I draw a dumb as-the-crow-flies straight line between stop points. I think [pfaedle](https://github.com/ad-freiburg/pfaedle) might be the best state-of-the-art tool for helping with that.

- Watched <cite>The Capture</cite> (2019â€“2022) over the last few weeks. It has some great infeasible user interfaces if you like that sort of thing.

- Went and saw [the] Sugababes, the Trigger's broom/ship of Theseus of pop music but their line-up's stayed a lot more stable than the Conservative front bench (little bit of politics there). That was a nice time. The audience could have shown the support acts some more reverence instead of nonchalantly talking amongst themselves the whole time, a little more chalance please.

- ðŸŽ¦ <cite>Ticket to Paradise</cite> (2022). Not too long, and set in a hot sunny place that's an antidote to the damp grey autumn. There's bit of thunderstorm that makes you turn in surprise to the back right-hand speaker. Froth, but there's nothing wrong with froth, apart from all the extra washing-up when you take a hand blender to hot milk to try to make a poncy coffee.
