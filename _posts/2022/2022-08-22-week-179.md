- Missed [the National Express 23X](https://bustimes.org/services/23x-london-victoria-basingstoke-imber/vehicles) by a fraction of a moment (mainly have myself to blame), so the lost village of Imber remains a mystery for another year. It would be cool if they put on that coach service again next year.

  Spent some time in Belgravia doing nothing instead. Some thoughts about the poncy [citizenM hotel](https://www.headforpoints.com/2022/07/10/review-citizenm-london-victoria-station-hotel/):

  - Since I last stayed in one, I think the silly iPad that controls the lights/blinds/TV/temperature has gotten harder to use, or have I just gotten older and dodderier? Oh well, untangling the electric blinds, and scrabbling round the back of the TV to turn it off and on again, was a fun little problem-solving challenge.

  - They still don't put tiny kettles in the rooms. I suppose they think they're being "courageous", like Apple removing the iPhone headphone jack. You can go downstairs where a barista will make you something frothy, but what if you want some horrible tea with a sachet of UHT milk? 

- People [getting mad at](https://twitter.com/supertanskiii/status/1560693292924379137) the trailer for <cite>This England</cite>, the dramatisation of some of the events of 2020, because it's a bit <cite>West Wing</cite>, makes people seem too statesmanlike, maybe?
They've got Andrew Buchan playing Matt Hancock, an inspired choice because [they do look alike](https://twitter.com/search?q=andrew%20buchan%20hancock%20until%3A2022-01-01&src=typed_query&f=live), but it's a shame he couldn't do something with his hair ([like Pete Campbell off of <cite>Mad Men</cite>](https://twitter.com/puppymoth/status/1539046835846782976)) to make him look even more like Matt Hancock.

- Liked the look of a cushion cover I saw in the background of a television drama.
  You'd think, by now, at the very least Amazon would have the technology to let you click on a soft furnishing and have a matching product delivered tout suite. They don't, but [Google Lens](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Google_Lens) exists. Of course most streaming services don't let you take a screenshot to upload, because a criminal might take enough screenshots to make a flipbook. But somehow I managed to find out that it was an Ikea <span class="caps">Fransine</span>, brilliant. They're available on eBay but I don't have any cushions to cover.
