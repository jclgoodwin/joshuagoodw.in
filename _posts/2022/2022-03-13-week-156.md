- <cite>The Batman</cite> was OK. Didn't actually feel too long. Top grunting by ... Robin Patterson? Bobby Pattinson?
  It was a surprise to see Trevor off <cite>EastEnders</cite>, even though, if I think about it, I had heard he was in it
  – and a bit spooky that he came up in last week's weeknotes too (as did the phrase "winged rat").

  The temperature of the cinema was just perfect.

- Some work.

  Suddenly I have sort of strategy: to automate/outsource more stuff, unlocking even more time for me to do ... who knows what?
  Which has been a strategy all along, but this week, with a newfound clarity, I did a little development and now I don't need to waste much time at all being bothered about the colouring-in of bus icons [on the bus map](https://bustimes.org/map) and the filling-in of other boring details about vehicles.
  And it's great, a weight has lifted, why didn't I do this sooner? I slightly disagree with the level of detail people want to add to the little moving rectangles – it's incredible what you can do with CSS – but it's OK, the point is not to think about it, and I no longer need to, so I just don't.

- Last week I cleaned the [disgusting little drip
  tray](https://metro.co.uk/2019/06/06/woman-uncovers-cause-horrible-smell-kitchen-lots-us-wont-know-9831978/) at the back of the refrigerator.
  I was in the area trying to make the freezer be quiet, and obviously cleaning a bit of a completely separate appliance had no effect on that,
  but in some small way I've made the place less smelly, or at least delayed the point at which it will start to stink.

  There are [YouTube videos](https://youtu.be/ge7PwyDSrnw?t=143) that will give you enough confidence to remove the drip tray for cleaning without breaking anything – it takes a bit of yanking. They're longer than neccesary – a few-seconds-long GIF would suffice – but ¯\\\_(ツ)\_/¯. (I linked to the timestamp of the crucial bit of the video there.)

- Is this my quarter-life crisis? Not sure what they usually involve – buying half a sports car? (I haven't.)
  As crises go, it has much to recommend it – funny things are funnier, beautiful things have more beauty, I'm even less angry.

  One thing I can share is my Sleep++ "Readiness Score" screen, which might be evidence that "the quantified self" isn't crap.

  Indeed I felt different on the low-scoring days, but I think the poor sleep was a symptom not the cause.
  This is boring, but actually so far this month I've had no alcohol and barely a cup of tea of caffeine per day,
  which science would have you believe is good for sleep – and my experience doesn't prove or disprove anything.

- The excessively manual blogging workflow means I keep misnumbering and misdating these posts – e.g. week 154 accidentally had the same date and title as 153 – and nobody appears to notice.
  And that's a relief as, obviously, by "accidentally" I really mean deliberately, to tempt anyone reading this into identifying themself by sending in a correction, and no one's blown their cover. Good work. Have a nice week.
