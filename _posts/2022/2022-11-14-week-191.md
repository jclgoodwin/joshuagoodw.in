- Leave me alone in a kitchen and there’s a good chance I’ll fix the clock on the oven, you know, if it's displaying the wrong time. Which is a bit cheeky really – not just because of the risk I'll accidentally activate the “child lock”, effectively breaking it, but also you've probably internalised the difference between the oven time and real time, using the power of your mind to subtract an hour or whatever, because you think mental arithmetic is good for you, so an unexpected correction could send you out of whack and make you late for things.

  Anyway, I was unprecedentedly slow to correct the oven clock here after the latest BST–GMT transition, but I've done it now.

- Other peoples’ dreams are always boring. Dreamt that some electricity/telegraph poles had been painted yellow – I guess by the utility company, not environmental protestors – and a pigeon perched on a pole had gotten painted too, and proudly stretched out its wings as if to say hey look at me I’m like a canary now. Cool story.

- It's nice to get out of the house:

  - 🎦 <cite>Triangle of Sadness</cite> is a terrific hoot . Learnt something about the name Yaya, which I’d read before and heard before but had never connected the two (somehow thought it was pronounced “Yay-a”).

  - David O’Doherty, the noted comedian who wears hats and rides bicycles and plays a little Yamaha keyboard (not all at the same time).

  - [Half Man Half Biscuit](https://halfmanhalfbiscuit.uk/theyre-gonna-be-unveiling-some-new-material/waterfront-norwich-gig-11-november-2022/ "I’ve never seen so many fucking weirdos under one roof in my life"). In a room packed full of mostly maybe increasingly weak-bladdered men, it's a good idea to be out of the way of the jostling of the sort of jetstream of folks going to and from the loo.

- Regrettably, started watching <cite class="caps">IACGMOOH</cite> for the first time. It is a bit compelling, entertaining, which must be why millions of people watch it. I think I have the mental strength to resist being brainwashed into feeling any sympathy for the Tory fellow.
