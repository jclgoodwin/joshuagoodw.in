- Last year I got a [Raspberry Pi TV Hat](https://www.amazon.co.uk/Melopero-Raspberry-DVB-TV-uHAT/dp/B07JKH36VR?tag=joshgood-21) and started using TVHeadend, it's a way of watching and recording digital terrestrial TV. It's fiddly, but I don't want to sound ungrateful for the free software and the signals that are just there vibrating in the air all around us. Surely better than _ITV Hub_ or whatever it's called this week, etc.

    Recently (since having to connect the thing to Wi-Fi, because the <abbr>FTTP</abbr> equipment is a long way from the TV socket and maybe the vacuum cleaner would get tangled up in a long Ethernet cable), there's been a disturbance in the force (?), some spooky glitches, like every few minutes. The visual effect is rather fascinating and quite cool, it's like in <cite>The Castafiore Emerald</cite> when Professor Calculus invents colour TV.

    Well, I got a new cable, and the reported signal-to-noise ratio is better and the problem has gone.
    It's famously usually bullshit when an employee of Dixons Carphone plc tries to [upsell](https://twitter.com/decentpatter/status/827237034871881728) you to a more expensive version of an <abbr>HDMI</abbr> or similar digital signalâ€“carrying cable, but there are other circumstances where you do need a wire that's shielded or something or at least not broken.

    Part of me misses the old glitches â€“ <cite>Saturday Kitchen</cite> is really boring without Matt Tebbutt transforming into colourful spaghetti every so often â€“ but maybe they can be recreated by half-unplugging the cable or waiting for a thunderstorm.

- I've had a few of the mass-produced festive sandwiches by now and ugh, the hegemony of cranberry. And maybe caramelised onions are an even more insidious pervasion â€“ I like an onion, and it was a wise person who suggested doubling the quantity of onion (and garlic) in any recipe you follow, but what do these sickly overpowering flavours have to do with Christmas?

- This is a bit late, it's been almost weeks since [John Harris was last angry at people with big trolleyloads not letting him go in front of them in the Lidl checkout queue](https://twitter.com/jrc1921/status/1592855913547063297). I actually enjoy the extra moment of quiet contemplation, standing there, marvelling at how much milk some people buy, but when I am beckoned to nip ahead I begrudgingly accept just because I know it makes them feel good to think they're doing me a favour, there's no such thing as a selfless act.

- ðŸŽ¦ <cite>The Menu</cite> (2022) was fine but somehow not viscerally wibbly.
