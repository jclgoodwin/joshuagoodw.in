- Some work, which can be summarised as "Why must they keep mucking about with everything?"
  To be clear, it's me who's mucking about with everything, and that's my right, in fact it's my job, thank you very much.

  The bit of mucking about I consider most successful (just because no one's remarked on it yet):
  inspired by the aesthetic <abbr>AF</abbr> [Overcast redesign](https://twitter.com/OvercastFM/status/1507371919607226376),
  I went and changed the font that folks using Apple platforms see on the website from <abbr title="San Francisco">SF</abbr> Pro to <abbr title="San Francisco">SF</abbr> Pro Rounded, and I think it's good?

- Friday. To London, mainly to see ["A Night For Ukraine"](https://twitter.com/chris_hawkins/status/1503484318617849872).
  A packed line-up of mostly I'm afraid unknown-to-me nineties bands (¯\\\_(ツ)\_/¯) and known-to-me comedians.
  Had a nice time anyway. A few years ago I listened to a lot of Sleeper for a bit.

  Here's a phenomenon: people holding their telephones aloft, shakily livestreaming to their friends.
  Which seems a bit cheeky, but am no a grass, and who's to say their friends hadn't actually bought tickets but just couldn't be there in person.
  Strategies differ: some hold the phone one-handed, the spare hand occasionally joining in to type a reply to a comment on the stream,
  whereas others go two-handed to reduce camera shake, holding their plastic cup of drink with their teeth.

  Just the previous evening, I'd seen ["Stand Up For Ukraine"](https://twitter.com/gofasterchris/status/1506558922479579152)
  from the comfort of a (legit) private YouTube link, so this was two consecutive evenings of seeing James Acaster and Milton Jones, and that's OK.

- The Central line gets busy doesn't it.

  Saturday. Thought I was being so clever, avoiding railway engineering works by catching a National Express coach,
  but turns out there's a sort of motorway equivalent, namely congestion and roadworks, so arrived an hour late in the end.
  Oh well, it was cheap and I had things to read and listen to and even got to look out of the window for the final hour.

  And I noticed and appreciated the subtle branding someone's added to the moving rectangles representing National Express coaches on the bustimes.org map ↑.
  When it was up to me I couldn't be bothered, but some people can, good for them, and sometimes it's good to bother.

- To the local provincial music venue for [Absolute Bowie](https://www.absolutebowie.com/),
  a great bunch of lads and quite good tribute act. A clever bit of superlative theatricality was how they did some long drawn-out instrumental bits so Zavid could go round the back for a costume change.
