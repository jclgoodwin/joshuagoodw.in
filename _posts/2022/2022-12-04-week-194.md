- The [DAX](https://global.com/dax/) advertising platform is convinced that I'm in Wales.
  None of the IP geolocation providers can locate me correctly – great for getting away with cyber crimes – but only [Ipregistry](https://ipregistry.co/) places me in Wales, so I guess that's who DAX use. Anyway, it means I'm hearing lots of audio ads from the Welsh Government, even some in the Welsh language, and it sounds bloody great – apparently they can help with the cost of childcare and help my business export things.

- The Ensignbus Heritage Running Day was a lovely day out, just like [last year](/2021/12/week-142). I wasn't very hardcore about maximally exploring, but there'll be other years.

  Gravesend. A brass band dressed as Father Christmases was playing <cite>Get Lucky</cite> (the sound of the summer) on the street outside the empty shell of Debenhams. I feel like I've heard more brass band covers than the original by now, but the crowd was greatly enjoying it. Then they played <cite>Let It Snow</cite> and everyone lost interest.
