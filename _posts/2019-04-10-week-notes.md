What happened this week?

I've been avoiding the ongoing news shitshow to a some extent.
To be precise, to such an extent that it took me until this week to start worrying that my hair might look a bit 
like a mixture of that of some dishonourable scrotes – Martin or Hoey, I'm thinking of.
This week, the penny dropped, so I cut my hair – my own hair, myself, using an electric thingie.

Now my head is more aerodynamic.
Maybe there are some tufts around the back, but it would be impossible to tell without rigging up a system of mirrors,
and "out of sight, out of mind".
None of the people who've stood behind me have mentioned any tufts, and I'm sure they weren't just being polite.

I'd said "avoiding", but I made an exception for
[<cite>Giles Wemmbley Hogg Goes Off... Article 50</cite>](https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/m0003jrw),
my cultural highlight of the week. It's OK.

I did some bits of work. One of the bits was trying to draw more accurately wiggly maps of bus routes,
after some surly complaints about the current jaggedy ones.
There's [a handy tool](https://github.com/graphhopper/map-matching) I started to use to match thinly dispersed coordinates to roads,
but it smartassedly avoids bus lanes – with only law-abiding motor cars in mind – which is the opposite of what I want to do.
So I'll have to try something else.
Cool story.
