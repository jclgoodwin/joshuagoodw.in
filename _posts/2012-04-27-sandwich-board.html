<p>I can&#8217;t be the first to say that <a href="http://sandwichvideo.com/">Adam &#8220;Sandwich Video&#8221; Lisagor</a> makes advertising videos so good, I just wish I had a mostly neat tech product to have him make one about.</p>
<p>The latest is this unofficial one for that warmly regarded &#8220;AeroPress&#8221; coffee syringe:</p>

<p>It&#8217;s of note that, like an animal, his kettle is not electric &#8211; rather, it operates by being sat on the stove. Clearly, it&#8217;s prettier than a typical electric one, and I don&#8217;t object to that superficiality or anything. But it turns out that, there in North America, <a href="http://wordpress.mrreid.org/2012/04/16/why-kettles-boil-slowly-in-the-us/" title="Why kettles boil slowly in the US">they aren&#8217;t so unusual anyway</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>An “average” [electric] kettle in the UK runs at about 2800 W and in the US at about 1500 W; if we assume that both kettles are 100% effi­cient then a UK kettle sup­plying 2800 joules per second will take 127 seconds to boil and a US kettle sup­plying 1500 J/s will take 237 seconds, more than a minute and a half longer. This is such a problem that many house­holds in the US still use an old-fashioned stove-top kettle.</p></blockquote>
<p>Well, now you know.</p>
