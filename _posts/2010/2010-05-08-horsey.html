<p>On Sunday &#8211; the Sunday before the most recent one &#8211; we went to a racecourse. There were horses running around with people on them, while other people &#8211; mainly posh sorts of ones &#8211; stood and watched and got excited. There were some people doing gambling &#8211; not to be confused for gambolling, which is not the best word for what the horses were doing. </p>
<p>After a while, the horses stopped and were replaced by some camels. Pretty crazy stuff, right?</p>
<p>I made a video about it:</p>

<p>It is not a particularly good video, but it is all right. It is quite a first &#8211; my first Samsung U10 video on YouTube, available in magical high definition. I don&#8217;t think QuickTime Pro is supposed to be good at video editing, but it shouldn&#8217;t cost Â£30. There are things that I might have done wrong that probably contributed to the sound and the pictures being out of sync. In some ways the disjointedness is good &#8211; it gives the impression of rolling around in a barrel while one&#8217;s ears are syringed. An &#8220;improved&#8221;, smoother version <em>could</em> follow &#8211; but only could. You are correct, nobody cares.</p>
