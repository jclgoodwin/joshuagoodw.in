<p>The Mike Flowers Pops are a British easy listening band known for lounge music covers of both older and contemporary pop music. The thin layer of hilarity must disintegrate after a while, but it&#8217;s being chipped away at with a chisel made of pâté, especially when there&#8217;s a video to see as well as the music to hear.</p>
<p>Here is <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vy1ueZf1WMQ">something</a> a bit excellent:</p>

<p>It&#8217;s a shame about the anamorphic letterboxing horrors. <a href="http://www.google.com/support/youtube/bin/answer.py?hl=en&#038;answer=146402">There are workarounds</a>, but the person who uploaded the video must have better things to do. Boo.</p>
<p>Also good is <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=947CVXtXNsk">this</a>. Make good use of the YouTube &#8220;Suggestions&#8221;, why don&#8217;t you?</p>
<p>You can <a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/dp/B001F4VEGO/?tag=joshgood-21">download the album from Amazon.co.uk</a>, whether or not you would like to. I did, and found that it&#8217;s a bit less good without the moving pictures, but that&#8217;s OK. <cite>Venus as a Boy</cite> (after Björk) is extraordinary.</p>
