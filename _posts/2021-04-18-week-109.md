- There's a new product called "Twinings Dark Mint" tea, part of [the "Twinings Dark Collection"](https://www.twinings.co.uk/our-communi-tea/twinings-teas/twinings-dark-collection).
  Unlike usual "peppermint tea", which a pedantic bore will call a tisane cos it's not made from any part of the tea plant,
  it's black tea with some added mint.
  Maybe it's very nice if prepared properly, but I treated it like peppermint tea and was so disgusted by the stewedness that I'm sorry to say I discarded the whole box.
  Please don't make the same mistake.

- Got one of the government-funded free-at-the-point-of-use lateral flow test kits, because who doesn't like something that's free.
  You get a pack of seven. Well, it's jolly difficult to shove a swab all the way up one's nostrils. Maybe mine are peculiarly ticklish.
  Anyway, I tested negative, you know, "positively toward negative" (sorry), which is good; now there are six more opportunities to see how deep the nostrils are.
