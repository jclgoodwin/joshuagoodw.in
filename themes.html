<p class="message"><strong>Warning:</strong> Old Popular Yolk hasn&#8217;t been updated since early 2010, and that seems unlikely to change. You should probably <a href="http://wordpress.org/themes/">find an alternative</a>.</p>
<p>Old Popular Yolk is a &#8220;theme&#8221; that I made for the popular <a href="http://wordpress.org">WordPress</a> blog software.</p>
<p>Eminently hackable, Old Popular Yolk can be easily tweaked beyond recognition &#8211; so if you don&#8217;t like the yellow, change it to blue or something, and so on. This can be attributed to the absence of any unnecessary frills, which also happens to let your writing shine through more readily.</p>

<p>Rainer Borene has very nicely created <a href="http://www.getsymphony.com/download/ensembles/view/33377/">a version for the Symphony software</a>.</p>
