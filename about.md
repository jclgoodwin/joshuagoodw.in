Hello, I'm ... well, that's obvious. This is my website.

I make the website [bustimes.org](https://bustimes.org) and I do some other stuff too.

I almost never post anything on <a rel="me" href="https://mastodon.social/@jgoodwin">Mastodon</a>, <a rel="me" href="https://www.instagram.com/jclgoodwin/">Instagram</a>, etc.
For completeness, I'm also on <a rel="me" href="https://www.last.fm/user/jclgoodwin">Last.fm</a> and <a rel="me" href="https://github.com/jclgoodwin">GitHub</a>.
