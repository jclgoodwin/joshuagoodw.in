Some time ago, I went to Italy.
I saw some nice sculptures, and some tremendous frescoes --
hey, why wait for plaster to dry before painting on it? --
but what really stuck with me was some paper towels.

You must understand that paper towels are often emblazoned with patterns.
[Toilet paper is often embossed](https://www.reddit.com/r/explainlikeimfive/comments/z7i87/why_does_toilet_paper_have_embossing_on_it/) --
with little pictures of dogs, for example, which is quite a messed up thing to wipe one's bum with, isn't it? --
and so are paper towels (also known as "kitchen paper"), sometimes with the added use of ink.

The Italian paper towels that really stuck with me were decorated with pictures of elephants holding watering cans.

I'm uncertain about a couple of things:
whether the elephants were holding the watering cans with their trunks or their forelegs,
and whether they were decorating the actual paper towels or the plastic packaging.
As you might expect, I've done some research:

- I think the towels were purchased from Conad, a Bolognese cooperative which isn't, as you might expect, a conflation of "Conan" and "gonad".

- I've found evidence of two paper towel brands in Italy who've depicted elephants on their packaging:

    -   Lucart's Tenderly brand -- which also does facial tissues and toilet paper -- has an elephant wearing a chef's toque on some of its kitchen roll packaging:

    -   Kimberly-Clark's Scottex brand is used for toilet paper --
        it's a cousin of the Cottonelle and Andrex used in other countries, even using the same picture of a labrador --
        but there's also Scottex kitchen paper, whose mascot is an even less realistic picture of an elephant:

        ![](/images/scottex1.jpg)

        Scottex's elephant is much more versatile, a true renaissance man or woman -- seen here in a Spanish graphic standing on its hind legs, wearing a chef's toque, holding a wooden spoon with a foreleg:

        ![](/images/scottex2.jpg)

        ...here holding a paintbrush:

        ...and here standing on one leg, using an excessive amount of paper:

        ![](/images/scottex3.jpg)

But there's no evidence of either elephant mascot having brandished a watering can.
And if it's been scrubbed from the web, then I'm not surprised, because what message is an elephant using a watering can supposed to send out?

Elephants are renowned for their trunks, proboscises that can suck up water -- a bit like what a paper towel can -- and squirt it out -- a bit like what a watering can can.
Showing an elephant using a watering can, as if manmade technology is somehow superior to an elephant's trunk, seems like some kind of imperialism.

The depiction of the elephant standing on their hind legs, holding tools with their front foot, is also disquieting.
A true elephant would walk on all four legs, and use their trunk to hold stuff -- .
