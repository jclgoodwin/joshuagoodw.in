title: What to do if your sticky notes won&#8217;t stick
publshed: false

<p>Some time ago, I tried various kinds of &#8220;off-brand&#8221; sticky note, and found that none of them were sticky enough: maybe OK for horizontal surfaces, but not for vertical ones like walls. Cash-strapped organisations are filling their stationery cupboards with these inferior products, but it&#8217;s a false economy: better to splash out on 3M&#8217;s <a href="http://pm.stackexchange.com/questions/3219/which-sticky-note-is-the-stickiest/3221#3221">&#8220;official&#8221;</a> Post-it® brand sticky notes than to endure low-quality glue in the service of pleasing corporate bean-counters. </p>
<p>So that&#8217;s what I did: I bought some Post-it® brand sticky notes, and they were good. But more recently, I bought some more, and they were a bit less good. Had some conspiratorial conspirators conspired to reduce the quality of the product?</p>
<p><strong>Turns out</strong>, the Post-it® notes I&#8217;d bought earlier were the &#8220;Super Sticky&#8221; variety. I had been mollycoddled by their super stickiness, and these ordinary ones were indeed less sticky in comparison.</p>
