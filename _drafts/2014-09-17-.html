<p>Here&#8217;s some:</p>
<p>Don’t follow the market. Lead the market. Beyond our visionary ideas, creative beauty, stimulating interaction, and jaw dropping animation, XAL experiences can be wired directly into the Xaxis DMP to provide unparalleled runtime decisioning and comprehensive audience analysis. Unlike publisher-by-publisher programs, having a single XAL execution across your whole plan reporting back into one data repository of record enables you to make more informed creative messaging decisions at ad time across all your inventory, and empowers you to holistically understand audience engagement and subsequently evaluate inventory sources. Additionally, many XAL executions can be provided as ‘added-value’ at certain spend levels against Xaxis Premium Inventory programs. So, creative excellence, unmatched runtime decisioning, holistic insight, and added value opportunities make XAL executions a distinct digital opportunity.</p>
