<p>He was the design director of Braun, the German consumer products company, before it was reduced to just another front for the makers of Pringles and soap powder. They now make little more than some shavers We have one of their immersion blenders, whose undercarriage is difficult to clean, so no-one really bothers, much like a skillet or a teapot spout.</p>
<p>When we first see him (above), he is prancing around some miniature ornamental plants, such that some of us might worry he will be a twit. But he isn&#8217;t, so it&#8217;s OK.</p>
